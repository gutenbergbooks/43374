<h1>GULF AND GLACIER.</h1>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br /><br />

<small>NORTHERN BOUND.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a bright July morning, and its
gladness was reflected in the faces of the throng
that hurried to and fro, like an army of particularly
busy ants, in the Boston and Lowell Depot.</p>

<p>Way trains puffed in and out, discharging their
loads of out-of-town people, who poured through
the doorway in an almost continuous stream, carrying
baskets of lunch, bunches of pond lilies
and the small parcels that tell of every-day trips
to the city.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the station stood a
Canadian Pacific train. The massive trucks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
heavy English build of the tawny cars distinguished
them from the stock required for local
traffic. This was the train which was to take
a hundred or more passengers, without change,
across the broad American Continent. From the
windows of those very cars, the travelers were to
look out upon the rolling Western prairies, the
ravines and snowy summits of the Rocky Mountains,
and at last, the blue waters of the Pacific.
No wonder the people on this side of the station,
those departing, as well as those to be left behind,
wore a more serious and anxious look upon
their faces than the light-hearted suburbans who
chatted gaily on their brief daily trip of a dozen
miles.</p>

<p>How curiously the hundred tourists looked into
one another&rsquo;s eyes? &ldquo;Will he prove a delightful
companion, I wonder?&rdquo; they said to themselves.
&ldquo;Is she to be a life-long friend, dating from this
moment when our paths meet for the first time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; shouts the conductor again.</p>

<p>It has been well said that a railway station is a
fit emblem of human life, with its brief merriment
and grief, its greetings and good-bys, its clamor of
coming and going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is probable that of the
half a thousand people in the Lowell Depot
that morning, but few abandoned themselves to
moral reflections. Certainly Tom Percival was
not occupied with philosophical meditation, as he
stood on the lowest step of the car &ldquo;Kamloops,&rdquo;
looking out eagerly over the crowd that surged
to and fro on the platform beside the train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Ran!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly, waving
his hat and beckoning to a young man of about
his own age, who was making his way toward the
car, valise in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; responded the other. &ldquo;Come
along, Fred,&rdquo; he added to a companion at his side.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;old cabin home&rsquo; for the next week
or so, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three young fellows&mdash;or boys, as it is
easier to call them, once for all&mdash;shook hands all
round, and then, standing on the car platform,
turned to the crowd again as the train started and
slowly moved out of the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by! good-by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure to write!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me a totem pole from Alaska!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And amid a medley of shouts and frantic wavings
of handkerchiefs the long train rumbled away,
northward bound.</p>

<p>Randolph Burton made his way into the car,
followed by his cousin Tom and their chum Fred
Seacomb. Randolph had just passed his Sophomore
examination successfully at Harvard, while
Tom was rejoicing over his admission to the
Freshman class, with only one condition. Fred
was a pupil in a scientific school at Philadelphia.
He was as dignified and scrupulously neat as ever,
and his eyeglasses twinkled as of old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the girls?&rdquo; inquired Randolph,
turning to Tom.</p>

<p>The car was filled with passengers, all talking
at once, and besieging the porter with questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our &lsquo;drawing-room,&rsquo; at the other end of
the car,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;You know father and
mother have a jolly little room all to themselves,
but we shall use it as headquarters, the whole way
to Vancouver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas alludes to Vancouver as if it were East
Somerville or Braintree,&rdquo; remarked Fred, eying
that young man calmly. &ldquo;How many times did
you say you had crossed the Continent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you concern yourself about me,&rdquo; rejoined
Tom. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d ground up on this trip as
I have, perhaps you&rsquo;d feel on familiar terms with
Assiniboia and Saskatchewan and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! here he comes, talking Indian as usual,&rdquo;
interrupted a merry voice. &ldquo;Randolph and Fred
are with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Miss Sibley!&rdquo; said Fred,
with his most elegant bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! please,&rdquo; laughed the sunny-haired girl,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be just &lsquo;Pet&rsquo; on this trip, any way.
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be seventeen till November, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys seemed relieved at this declaration,
and, perching on the arms of the car seats, entered
into lively conversation with Pet, as well as
Tom&rsquo;s sisters, Kittie and Bess.</p>

<p>The whole party, it may now be explained, had
started on a journey to Alaska. The young people
had worked hard at their studies during the
winter, and Mr. Percival, being a man of ample
means, as well as of good sense and thoroughly
kind heart, had included in his invitation Pet
Sibley and Fred Seacomb, both of whom are
familiar to the readers of the earlier volumes of
this series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>They had been undecided where to go for the
summer, when a friend of Mrs. Percival&rsquo;s told her
of this grand &ldquo;Excursion,&rdquo; which was to take its
patrons from sea to sea, up the coast of Alaska,
and back by way of Yellowstone Park, all within
the space of seven weeks. Careful inquiries satisfied
Mr. Percival and his wife that this was just
the trip they were looking for; places were secured,
and the start was now fairly made, as we
have seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Percival, coming
up at this moment, &ldquo;have you found your berths
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, father,&rdquo; said Tom, throwing his arm
lovingly over the man&rsquo;s broad shoulder. They
were very near to each other, these two, and the
companionship of this long journey was destined
to bring them together more closely than ever
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Randolph, you and Tom are next to our drawing-room,
on the &lsquo;starboard&rsquo; side. Fred comes
next, taking the upper berth at night. Some gentlemen
in the party will probably occupy the lower
one. Kittie and Bess are directly opposite, and
Miss Pet will come next.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice! Then we&rsquo;re all together, right in
this end of the car!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear! I wish we had Bert and Sue Martin
with us this year!&rdquo; lamented Kittie. &ldquo;They
would just fill those two odd berths, one on each
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em, Kit,&rdquo; replied her brother.
&ldquo;The whole family have gone out to Portland,
Oregon, with their married sister. You know she
and her husband are going to live there, where he
is in business, and that left Bert and Sue here
with only their grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We pass through Portland, I believe,&rdquo; added
Mr. Percival, &ldquo;on our return trip. We&rsquo;ll drop in
on them if we can, for a short call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the train was running at full speed,
and the young people began to explore their surroundings.
The country through which they were
passing was so familiar that they found more objects
of interest within the car than without.</p>

<p>There were a dozen other passengers in the
&ldquo;Kamloops,&rdquo; all chattering briskly and settling
themselves into the cosey quarters they were to
call home for the next ten days.</p>

<p>Fred Seacomb, as usual, began making acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ances
at once. Before they reached Lowell he
had raised an obstinate window for one of his nearest
neighbors, had found a missing pair of spectacles
for a sweet-faced old lady not far away, and
had pointed out various objects of interest (though
he knew less of them than any other member of
his party) to a bashful boy and girl of about ten
and twelve respectively, in the front seats.</p>

<p>People began to glance to the Percival end of
the car, and their faces relaxed into genial smiles
as Tom struck up &ldquo;Annie Rooney,&rdquo; the rest chiming
in melodiously. Before long their company
was increased by the two occupants of the vacant
berths. They introduced themselves as Rev. Rossiter
Selborne and his sister, Miss Adelaide Selborne.
The young clergyman could not have been
over thirty; his sister, a tall, pale, timid girl, was
apparently of about Kittie&rsquo;s age. The new-comers
were evidently painfully conscious of the questioning
glances with which they were greeted, and
were anxious not to intrude; Adelaide, in particular,
looking very shy and almost ready to cry when
she saw what a large party she and her brother
had unintentionally joined, and how thoroughly
the others all knew one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Percival soon broke the ice, however, by
inviting Mr. Selborne and his sister into her drawing-room
for a call, and in another fifteen minutes
they were swept into the current of song. The
young minister proved to have a fine baritone
voice, and his sister soon won popularity by remembering
second verses which everybody else
had forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weirs! Weirs!&rdquo; shouted the conductor. And
out flew the young folks to the platform, only to
be hustled back again, barely in time to miss being
left behind. The train was special, and took
no passengers beyond the favored hundred who
constituted the Excursion.</p>

<p>The shores of fair Winnepesaukee were soon
left behind, and the train drew up at the Pemigewasset
House, in Plymouth.</p>

<p>Up the long flight of steps they scrambled,
&ldquo;Tom leading the way, as usual,&rdquo; remarked dignified
Fred, peering through his eyeglasses at the
other&rsquo;s heels, far in advance.</p>

<p>Down again to the train&mdash;how familiar and
home-like the old &ldquo;Kamloops&rdquo; looks, already!
&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; Hurrah! Off we go again! Singing
once more&mdash;this time the &ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s Fare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>well&rdquo;;
Tom striking it a third too high, and going
all to pieces on the second &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo;&mdash;on and
on and on, faster and faster and faster, up the
beautiful Passumpsic Valley, along the shores of
Memphremagog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cries Bess. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shower on
the hills!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clouds hang, black and sullen, along the
mountain-tops. Dash! comes the rain in long exclamation
points all over the window-panes. A
glittering flash of lightning, trees bowing in the
wind, rain pouring in torrents.</p>

<p>Suddenly a brilliant light strikes again through
the windows, resting on Pet&rsquo;s golden hair&mdash;not
lightning this time, but the blessed sunshine, in
long, slanting rays from the west. Even the boys
catch their breath with delight and something like
awe as they see the clouds rolling away over the
mountains.</p>

<p>At about sunset, the principal &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; of
the Excursion, whom we will call Mr. Houghton&mdash;a
jolly, good-natured gentleman, who won first
the confidence and then the regard of his hundred
charges, at the very outset&mdash;came through the
car announcing that at about half-past eight they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
would be in Montreal, where the train would wait
for them forty-eight hours, the next day being
Sunday.</p>

<p>In due time the cars thundered over the long
steel bridge between Caughnawaga and Lachine,
the lights of Montreal twinkled out of the darkness,
and our friends were soon on their way to
the Windsor, where they were to spend the next
two days.</p>

<p>Sunday was as fair as the most exacting traveler
could wish. The large party scattered during the
forenoon, most of them going to church. Randolph
and Tom, with the girls, left the hotel early
and walked for a mile or more through the streets
of the city.</p>

<p>There were many French inhabitants, as the shop
signs showed. In a little common, they saw the
sign, &ldquo;<i>N&rsquo;allez pas sur le gazon</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a polite way
of putting our familiar &ldquo;Keep off the grass.&rdquo; The
names of the streets carried them back to old
times, when the whole province was held by
France&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ste. Monique</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Ste. Genevieve</i>,&rdquo; etc.
Funny little milk carts went bobbing along over
the rough pavements, and funny little babies toddled
along the uneven board sidewalks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Their walk soon brought them to a lofty granite
building with two square towers&mdash;the cathedral
of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>People were flocking in at the doors, and the
young Americans went with them.</p>

<p>It was like entering a great, dimly-lighted
cavern. All the walls and pillars and ceiling were
glowing with soft, dark crimson and golden colors.
The church was crowded with worshipers, not
only on the main floor, but in two immense galleries,
one above the other. At the further end
was the high altar and the figure of the crucified
Saviour, beneath which the priests were conducting
the service of the Roman Catholic Church.
One could just hear their deep voices, mingling
with the music of the choir and organ.</p>

<p>In front of the travelers was a swarthy Indian,
with long, glossy black hair. Little children knelt
on the marble pavement in the midst of the crowd.
Members of wealthy French families passed down
the aisle to their pews. All around were poor
people, many of them following the service with
their prayer-books.</p>

<p>Leaving Notre Dame, the Percivals turned
their steps to St. George&rsquo;s Church near the hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
where there was an Episcopal service, and a
good sermon by a bluff, hearty Scotchman, one
of whose phrases clung to Tom&rsquo;s memory for many
a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know of anything you ought to do,&rdquo;
said the good rector, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sit down and think
about it, but do ut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do ut!&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Tom to himself as he left
the church with the rest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good motto
for me, any way. &lsquo;Do ut!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quiet drive around Mount Royal&mdash;giving
them a glorious view of Montreal&mdash;filled the
afternoon.</p>

<p>As they looked down on the multitude of roofs
and steeps, Mr. Percival reminded them that it
was the chief city of Canada, with a population
about half as large as that of Boston. In 1535 it
was a little Indian village called Hochelaga, which
was in that year visited by Jacques Cartier. Two
hundred and fifty years ago, the French established
a trading-post here, and its business has
grown, until to-day its docks are lined with warehouses,
its river front shows the black hulls of
great ocean steamers, and railroads converge from
east, west and south.</p>

<p>We will close this first chapter with an extract
from Kittie&rsquo;s letter to Susie Martin, written late
Monday afternoon.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Montreal</span>, <i>July 21, 18&mdash;</i>.
</p>

<p class='noidt'><span class="smcap">Dear Sue</span>:</p>

<p>Bess has written you about our starting away from Boston day
before yesterday, and the splendid ride we had, and the showers,
and everything. We are getting to like that quiet Mr. Selborne
a good deal. His sister is dreadfully afraid of everything, and
keeps saying, &ldquo;O, Ross!&rdquo; whenever he does anything out of the
primmest kind of behavior. I guess we girls shock her awfully;
but perhaps she needs electricity treatment; she isn&rsquo;t strong, you
know, poor thing.</p>

<p>This afternoon we all went out to Lachine in a queer little
train of cars, and then went on board a big steamer for the return
trip down the river. Such a scramble for good places! It was
really wonderful, dear, going down those rapids. You felt the
great ship settle under your feet, and once we headed so straight
for a rock in the middle of the river that I said &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; right out
loud. The other passengers didn&rsquo;t laugh much, either, and even
Tom, poor fellow, really looked white.</p>

<p>Well, we have repacked our trunks which we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t open
again until we reach some sort of a queer place called Banff, next
Saturday. We go on board our train again at half-past seven.
Bess and I are expecting lots of fun in our compartment. I do
hope we shall see you in Portland....</p>

<p class='right'>
Affectionately, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br /><br />

<small>FOREST AND PRAIRIE.</small></h2>


<p>It was a merry party that assembled in the Windsor
Station, Monday evening. No sooner had
they found their places in the &ldquo;Kamloops&rdquo; than
out they jumped again, and began promenading
up and down the long platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what the names of the other cars
are,&rdquo; said Fred; and Bess, thereupon, called them
out, as they walked beside the train: &ldquo;&lsquo;Calgary,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nepigon,&rsquo; &lsquo;Toronto,&rsquo; &lsquo;Missanabie.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they mean?&rdquo; inquired Kittie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re names of Alaskan chieftains,&rdquo;
replied Randolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kamloops&rsquo; was the old head one, then,&rdquo;
added Tom.</p>

<p>But Mr. Houghton, who was everywhere at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
once, superintending the embarkation, caught the
words and explained that the names were those
of cities and towns on the line of the Canadian
Pacific.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; came the now familiar call, and
away went the train, out into the night, bound for
the far West.</p>

<p>The Percivals and their neighbors sang for a
while, adding several new college songs to their
previous répertoire, and then the head of the
family announced that it was time to retire. The
porter, William, had already arranged the drawing-room,
and amid a chorus of &ldquo;Good-nights,&rdquo; Mr.
and Mrs. Percival withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, William,&rdquo; said Randolph, &ldquo;make up Number
Three and Five for the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Four, for the gentlemen,&rdquo; added the
irrepressible Tom.</p>

<p>Kittie and Bess soon disappeared behind their
curtains, and the rest having followed suit shortly
afterward, there was silence&mdash;for about three
minutes. Then came the sound of a bump, and a
delighted chuckle from Tom, in the upper berth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming right up through, Ran?&rdquo; the girls heard
him ask. &ldquo;I thought the train was off the track.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You laugh much more, and I&rsquo;ll get up there,
somehow&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, boys,&rdquo; came Fred Seacomb&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Fred&rdquo; (from Tom), &ldquo;lend me your eyeglasses,
will you? I&rsquo;ve lost my pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Miss Adelaide became fearfully
thirsty, and putting her head out between her curtains,
timidly called across to her brother to
&ldquo;please get her a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Reverend Rossiter, who was just settling
himself for a nap, dressed again, and staggered off
down the car, returning with the welcome draught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody else want any?&rdquo; he asked good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Everybody was thirsty, and the clergyman&rsquo;s ministrations
with his cups of cold water did not cease
until he had made several journeys to the ice tank.</p>

<p>During the night the heavy train rumbled
steadily along over two hundred and fifty miles of
iron rails, and when Randolph awoke next morning,
he found they were at Chalk River, a small
town on the frontiers of the great forest wilderness
of inner Canada, where a fifteen-minute stop
was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Breakfast was served in the dining-car. Our
friends secured seats close together, and made a
jolly meal of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; observed Fred, &ldquo;to eat a breakfast
twenty miles long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo; laughed Tom, helping himself
to griddle cakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so pretty outside that I can&rsquo;t stop to
eat,&rdquo; exclaimed Adelaide, with a nice little flush
in her cheeks.</p>

<p>She had lived a very quiet, home-keeping life,
the girls found. Everything was new and strange
and wonderful to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say somebody had been pretty careless
with their camp-fires,&rdquo; Randolph remarked, as
they passed mile after mile of burned timber land,
an hour or two later.</p>

<p>Mr. Houghton told them that thousands upon
thousands of acres of forest near the railroad had
been ruined in this way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Randolph, &ldquo;how long has this
railroad been built?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Houghton thereupon gave them a brief
account of the Canadian Pacific, one of the marvels
of modern engineering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A railway from Canada to the Pacific,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;laid all the way on British soil, was long
the dream of public-spirited Canadians and Englishmen.
On the confederation of the British
Provinces in 1867, it became a real necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen must have a means of transporting
troops, arms and ammunition from the home stores
to the extremities of her dominion. Suppose her
Pacific cities, existing and to be built, should be
attacked by a foreign power. She can now throw
fifty thousand men across the Continent in four
days; or in less than a fortnight from Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it must have been a tough job
to get through this wilderness,&rdquo; said Randolph,
glancing out of the window at the wild district
through which they were passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much of the route lay through unexplored
country. All about Lake Superior the engineers
found a vast rocky region which opposed them at
every step. You&rsquo;ll see for yourselves to-morrow.
Beyond Red River for a thousand miles stretched
a great plain, known only to the Indian and fur
trader; then came the mountains, range after
range, in close succession, and all unexplored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did they really get to work?&rdquo; asked
Fred Seacomb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1875. The Government undertook the enterprise,
and afterward handed it over for completion,
to a private company. The explorations&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this point in the conductor&rsquo;s story, the
train began to slow up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, rising from his seat and
glancing at his watch, &ldquo;this is North Bay, on
Lake Nipissing. We stop here half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted Tom, as the train came
to a standstill, and down he rushed toward the shore
of the lake, only a few rods distant. &ldquo;Now, Captain
Bess, let&rsquo;s see what you can do for a fire. I&rsquo;ll have
one going before you get your match lighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bessie evidently accepted the challenge on the
spot, for although she said nothing, she began
hunting about for kindling at once. There had
been a light shower the night before, and every
thing was damp.</p>

<p>Tom made a great fuss, scrambling about for
chips and twigs, which he threw down in a heap
on the pebbly beach, kneeling beside them, and
hastily pulling a match from his pocket. It looked
as though his sister was beaten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait a bit,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Percival, who
was watching the contest with interest. Several
passengers from the other cars also gathered
about the fire-builders, applauding each in turn.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s first match spluttered, and went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! she&rsquo;s given up,&rdquo; he cried, as Bess walked
away from the group.</p>

<p>But the girl knew what she was about. She
stooped down beside a large log which had long
ago drifted ashore. From its upper surface she
stripped some thin shreds of birch bark, and beneath
it she found a handful of chips, perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>Back she came, and down she went on the pebbles,
at a little distance from her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Tom!&rdquo; shouted Randolph.</p>

<p>For Tom&rsquo;s fire did not seem to progress favorably.
Several matches had already been blown
out by the fresh lake breeze, and the few twigs
that had at last caught, now smoked feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the meanest wood!&rdquo; labored Tom.
&ldquo;Wet&rsquo;s water.&rdquo; And he essayed another match.</p>

<p>All this time Bessie had worked industriously,
saying nothing. She had broken and whittled
her chips into small pieces, and now pulled off her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
pretty yachting cap, holding it closely over the
bark while she struck her first match. Protected
by her dress, and gathering courage in the shelter
of the cap, it flared up cheerfully, catching the
crisp edges of the bark in grand style.</p>

<p>Down goes the cap, the girl&rsquo;s brown hair escaping
in little curly tresses that toss in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost got it!&rdquo; shouts Tom, blowing at
his smoking heap with all his might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in, old fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Bess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passengers added their cheers and laughter
to the cries of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Bess triumphantly, leaning back
from her fire.</p>

<p>For fire it was, truly, with the red flames dancing
upward gleefully through the twigs, and cracking
in a manner that said plainly they had come
to stay.</p>

<p>Tom generously joined in the applause that followed,
and heaped all his hoarded fuel on his
sister&rsquo;s fire, nearly extinguishing it in his zeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camp Birch!&rdquo; said Mr. Percival, naming it,
as they named all their camp-fires.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the coals were scattered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
for safety; and the engine giving its preconcerted
call, the passengers hurried on board once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Selborne, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hear the rest of
the railroad story, Mr. Houghton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter gentleman, by no means averse to
the task, accordingly continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The surveys for the road made known the
character of the country it had to traverse. In
the wilderness about Superior, were found forests
of pine and other timber, together with valuable
farming land, and mineral deposits of immense
value. The prairies beyond Winnipeg proved
wonderfully promising for settlers; the mountains
were seamed with coal, and sparkling with gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Houghton&rsquo;s face became even more radiant
than usual, as he told of the wonderful riches of
British Columbia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1881 the company contracted with the
Government to finish the road within ten years&mdash;for
which undertaking they received twenty-five
million dollars, twenty-five million acres of agricultural
land, and the railroad itself when complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Tom. &ldquo;Say, Ran, let&rsquo;s go
to railroading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end of the third year,&rdquo; continued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
genial conductor, &ldquo;found them at the summit of
the Rocky Mountains; the fourth in the Selkirks,
a thousand miles beyond Winnipeg. Sometimes
they advanced five or six miles a day, armies of
men attacking the mountains with thousands of
tons of dynamite. On a certain wet morning&mdash;the
seventh of November, 1885&mdash;the last spike
was driven on the main line of the Canadian
Pacific Railway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Houghton&rsquo;s eloquent peroration was followed
by a round of applause, and all hands turned
to the car windows once more, with new interest
in this great triumph of mind over the forces of
nature.</p>

<p>The boys were informed by Mr. Houghton in
conclusion, that the country all around the lake
was one of the greatest hunting districts on the
continent. The forest abounded, he said, in
moose, bear and caribou&mdash;all of which was extremely
tantalizing to these young gentlemen,
though the gentler members of the party took
little interest in the conductor&rsquo;s description of
the sport.</p>

<p>We must pass rapidly over the next day or
two. Soon after breakfast on Wednesday morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ing,
our travelers found themselves on the shores
of Lake Superior, and all day the train kept close
beside it, the road curving, rising, descending,
around great promontories of red rock, at the base
of high cliffs, and across broad tributaries that
came sweeping down from far Northern wastes.
At times there was a heavy fog, through which
the passengers could see the slow waves breaking
on the rocks below. Then it would lift, showing
new beauties close at hand, and bright, wooded
islands in the misty distance. Beside the track
grew strange flowers, and against the northern
sky was outlined the notched edge of the boundless
evergreen forest that stretched away to the
Arctic solitudes.</p>

<p>At the little settlement of Peninsula, Selborne
called the rest to see a fine, sturdy dog with the
Esquimaux showing plainly in his pointed nose
and ears, and thick soft fur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look like the pictures in Dr.
Kane?&rdquo; whispered Pet, leaning over Kittie&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>Jackfish proved to be a picturesque hamlet of
log huts, clustering on a rocky point of land that
jutted into the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The train stopped at Schreiber long enough to
allow the party to dash up into the town, and
make a laughable variety of purchases at the principal
store. Postal cards, buttons, candy and
fancy pins disappeared in the pockets of the
tourists, to the delight of the proprietor, who had
not had such a run of custom for many a long day.
Captain Bess bought several yards of the brightest
scarlet ribbon she could find&mdash;for what purpose
it will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>Near the station at Nepigon was seen the first
encampment of Indians&mdash;Chippewas they were;
half-amused, half-indignant at the curious crowd
they attracted.</p>

<p>Port Arthur was the terminus of the Eastern
Division of the &ldquo;C. P. R.,&rdquo; a thousand miles from
Montreal, and watches were all set back one hour
to meet &ldquo;Central Time.&rdquo; Little girls crowded up
to the passengers, selling milk in broken mugs,
from small pails with which they darted hither
and thither along the platform. I should hardly
venture to say how many mugfuls the boys
bought and drank, in the kindness of their hearts.</p>

<p>That evening a number of new friends from the
&ldquo;Missanabie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Calgary&rdquo; came back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
&ldquo;Kamloops,&rdquo; by special invitation, and the united
chorus sang over and over all the songs they did&mdash;and
did not&mdash;know. &ldquo;Little Annie Rooney,&rdquo;
then a reigning favorite in the East, was the
most popular number in the programme.</p>

<p>I wish I could show the gay little party to you,
as I see them now, photographed so clearly upon
my memory: the older people in the rear, looking
on with smiles, and occasionally joining in a
familiar chorus; Kittie and Pet, their faces all
aglow; Randolph, Fred and Mr. Selborne singing
sturdily along, or pausing when they did not know
the tune; Tom, singing at the top of his voice,
whether he knew the tune or not, and beating
time with a vigor that would have put Carl Zerrahn
to shame&mdash;ah! how it all comes before me
as I write; with one dear, kindly face that was
merry and thoughtful by turns, but always tender
and loving and good, as the songs rang out; the
face I shall see no more until I reach the end of
the longest journey of all&mdash;the journey of Life!</p>

<p>At breakfast on the following morning, Tom,
who had taken upon himself to provide the girls
with nosegays on the whole trip, marched into
the dining-car with a neat little breast-knot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
&ldquo;squirrel-tail grass&rdquo; which he had picked at Rat
Portage, for each young lady. It was very pretty,
but before long the objectionable feature of the
grass asserted itself; that is, its clinging qualities,
which made it impossible for the wearers to wholly
rid themselves of the tiny barbed spires for two
days afterward.</p>

<p>Winnipeg was reached at noon. Nearly all the
passengers &ldquo;went ashore,&rdquo; and the empty cars
were trundled away for a thorough cleaning,
English fashion.</p>

<p>In twos and threes our friends wandered off
through this strange young city, the capital of
Manitoba. Twenty years ago its population numbered
one hundred; now it passes thirty thousand!</p>

<p>In the midst of all the progress and modern
ideas of bustling Winnipeg, it was curious to
notice many rude carts drawn by oxen, which
were harnessed like horses.</p>

<p>At the station the &ldquo;newsboys&rdquo; were little girls,
who plied their trade modestly and successfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival took his daughters and Pet to
drive for an hour through the city and its suburbs.
The only drawback to their enjoyment was the
intense heat, and the abundance of grasshoppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
who would get tangled up in Bessie&rsquo;s hair, much
to that young lady&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clouds and clouds of them,&rdquo; she commented
indignantly; &ldquo;and the Winnipeggers don&rsquo;t seem
to mind them a bit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning Tom was the first &ldquo;on deck,&rdquo; as
usual, and out of the cars at the first stop, which
was made to water the engine. Prairie, prairie,
prairie, as far as the eye could reach. Tom gathered
handfuls of flowers and threw them into
expectant laps, only to rush out again and gather
more. The short grass was starred with blossoms
of every color. Harebells, like those on Mt.
Willard, grew in abundance beside the track. Then
there were queer, scarlet &ldquo;painted cups,&rdquo; nodding
yellow ox-eyes, asters, dandelions, and others.</p>

<p>What is that little creature, that looks something
like a very large gray squirrel with no tail?
Why, a &ldquo;gopher,&rdquo; to be sure; an animal resembling
a prairie-dog, only smaller. They live in
burrows all along these sandy embankments. See
that little fellow! He sits up on his hind legs
and hops along like a diminutive kangaroo, pulling
down heads of grass with his tiny forepaws, and
nibbling the seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>On and on, over the rolling prairie, rattled the
hot, dusty train. They were in Indian country
now, and at every station a dozen or more dark-faced
Crees crouched on the platform, offering
buffalo horns for sale.</p>

<p>And this reminds me that I have not mentioned
one very important portion of Tom&rsquo;s outfit. It
was a fine No. 4 Kodak, of which he was very
proud, and which he &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; mercilessly at all
sorts of persons and things on the journey. There
were other amateur photographers on the Excursion&mdash;a
dozen or more in all&mdash;and great was the
good-natured rivalry in securing good views. Indians
were bribed, soldiers flattered and precipices
scaled in this fascinating pursuit. As to the hundred
travelers, the photographers snapped at them
and one another with hardly an apology; and as
the subject usually looked up and smiled broadly
at the critical moment, the general result must
have been a collection of portraits of the most
marvelously and uniformly merry company that
ever boarded a C. P. R. train, or kodaked a Siwash
canoe.</p>

<p>Each wielder of this terrible weapon had a different
way of holding the camera and doing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
deed. Mr. Selborne focused from under his
right arm, that embraced the instrument firmly.
Pet, who had a little No. 1, always winked hard,
and occasionally jumped when she &ldquo;pressed the
button&rdquo;; thereby, as she afterward discovered,
giving her characters a peculiar misty effect, which
she declared was enchanting. One indefatigable
lady from Kalamazoo invariably held her kodak
out in front of her at arms-length, and took aim
over the top of it before firing; a proceeding
which never failed to disconcert and terrify the
subject beyond description.</p>

<p>At a settlement called Swift Current, Tom
undertook to photograph an old Cree squaw, who
stalked away indignantly around the corner of the
freight house. Away went crafty Thomas in the
opposite direction, meeting the squaw just half-way
around the building. Tom tried to purchase
a sitting with a silver quarter, but the wrathful
Indian woman poured out a torrent of Cree invective,
and hooked at him with a pair of buffalo
horns she held in her hands. Finally, he turned
his back to her, and holding the camera backward
under his arm, pressed the button and so obtained
one of his best negatives on the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be confessed that he felt rather shabby
in thus procuring her portrait against her will;
and to atone for his conduct, Bessie knelt beside
two little Indian girls and tied bright red ribbons
on their arms, to their intense delight.</p>

<p>At Moose-Jaw (which Mr. Houghton said was
an abridgment of the Indian name meaning,
&ldquo;The-creek-where-the-white-man-mended-the-cart-with-a-moose&rsquo;s-jaw-bone&rdquo;),
the travelers were shown
a villainous-looking Sioux, who was one of Sitting
Bull&rsquo;s band that massacred General Custer and
his troops a few years before. The Indians in
that whole section of Canada are kept in order by
mounted police&mdash;fine-looking fellows, sauntering
about the station platforms with whip and spur,
and by no means averse to having their pictures
taken, Pet found.</p>

<p>All this is very pleasant, but as the day wears
on, the green hills and flowery meadow-land give
place to scorched, parching, alkali desert, stretching
away in dry, tawny billows as far as the eye
can reach. Here and there is a lake&mdash;no, a pool
of dry salt, like the white ghost of a lake. The
air in the cars becomes insufferably hot. Look at
the thermometer, where the sun does not shine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and the air blows in through the open window. It
marks full 105°. Mr. Selborne wins popularity
by contracting for a large pitcher of iced lemonade,
which he passes through the car. Dust and
cinders pour in at doors and windows with the hot
air. Waves of heat rise from the shriveled grass.
Will night ever come?</p>

<p>Yes, it comes at last, as God&rsquo;s good gifts always
come, to refresh and sweeten our lives. The sky
flushes with sunset light. Shadows creep up
from the east; a cool breeze touches the fevered
faces. Night, beautiful, restful, kindly night,
spreads its wings over the weary travelers, and,
still flying onward through the darkness, they
sleep peacefully and dream of the dear New
England hills and of home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br /><br />

<small>A HOME LETTER.</small></h2>


<p class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Banff</span>, <i>July 26, 189&mdash;</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class='noidt'>Dear mother:</p>

<p>I know you will want to hear from your
children as often as possible, so I write to-day, for
both Adelaide and myself, to tell you of our wanderings,
and of the wonderful scenes in the midst
of which we are resting this bright Sunday.</p>

<p>In my last letter mailed at Brandon, I told you
about the railroad ride from Montreal, north of
the Great Lakes, through the country where the
Jesuit missionaries labored so nobly two centuries
ago, and across the green prairies and scorched
alkali desert of Manitoba.</p>

<p>On the morning after that terribly hot day, we
looked westward&mdash;and our journey seemed likely
to come to an end then and there. A mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
barrier stretched across our path from north to
south. Rising dimly, through the morning mists,
their summits hidden among the clouds, their
tawny flanks scarred with ravines and whitened
with snow, rose the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Soon the train stopped, and we were told of a
cascade in the woods near by, bearing the Indian
name of Kananaskis. Off we tramped across a
bit of flowery upland, snatching handfuls of aster,
painted cup and harebell as we went; then down
through a thicket of blue-tipped firs, until we
heard the voice of many waters calling softly
to us.</p>

<p>Another moment and we stood on the brink of
the foaming, dashing, sparkling cataract, pouring
grandly down its rocky path, as it had done in the
days of Paul and Barnabas of Joshua; yes, and of
Ahasuerus the king. At the very moment when
Queen Esther, the &ldquo;Star,&rdquo; stood before the
haughty monarch pleading for her people, the
stars above shone above the white falls of Kananaskis
as they do to-night; the rushing waters
lifted up their voice and hastened to their work in
the lonely forest; while the Father of all looked
down on the silent firs, the silver stream, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
proud walls of Shushan, patient and loving, waiting
for his children to know him and his wonderful
works, and to love and serve him with
gladness of heart.</p>

<p>Oh, the mountains! How we climbed and
climbed, the train winding, and roaring, and straining
every iron nerve to bear us to the high
places! At noon we were in the midst of them.
They looked down upon us with kindly faces,
yet their granite peaks were awful in their grandeur,
uplifted thousands upon thousands of feet
above us.</p>

<p>I wandered with a bright young girl in our
party, Miss Bessie Percival, whom the boys call
&ldquo;Captain Bess,&rdquo; down a steep path to the river&rsquo;s
brink. Beneath a sheltering fir which stretched
its tiny crosses above our heads, we stopped,
and with a tiny, crackling fire beside us, watched
the snowy heights, and the hastening river.
The harebells, frailest and gentlest of flowers,
were there too, to remind us that the same Hand
which which&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;Set on high the firmament,<br />
Planets on their courses guided,<br />
Alps from Alps asunder rent,&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p class='noidt'>was his who said to the storm, &ldquo;Peace, be still!&rdquo;&mdash;who
&ldquo;considered the lilies,&rdquo; and who took little
children in his arms and blessed them.</p>

<p>The waters of the large river which ran past us
were turbid with soil from their far-off source; but
a small stream entered the larger one near our
little fir-shaded hearthstone, and this new-comer
was fresh from the snowy hill-tops, &ldquo;clear as crystal.&rdquo;
As far down as we could see, the rivulet
never lost its brightness, but swept onward with
the larger stream, sweetening and purifying it, yet
&ldquo;unspotted,&rdquo; like a true and simple life in God&rsquo;s
world.</p>

<p>There, I won&rsquo;t tire you any more to-night, dear
mother. How it would add to our pleasure if you
were here! Adelaide gains strength every day,
the wholesome, hearty companionship of these
young people doing her quite as much good, I
think, as the novelty and grandeur of the scenes
in which she finds herself. As for me, I ought to
preach better sermons all my life, for this trip.
This afternoon while I was sitting on the rounded
piazza of the hotel, looking out upon the valley
and snowy mountain-tops, a bit of blank verse came
into my mind. I&rsquo;m going to write it out for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
A fellow can send his mother poetry (?) which he
wouldn&rsquo;t show any one else, can&rsquo;t he?</p>

<p class='poem'>
Within thy holy temple have I strayed,<br />
E&rsquo;en as a weary child, who from the heat<br />
And noonday glare hath timid refuge sought<br />
In some cathedral&rsquo;s vast and shadowy nave,<br />
And trembles, awestruck, crouching in his rags<br />
Where high up reared a mighty pillar stands.<br />
Mine eyes I lift unto the hills, from whence<br />
Cometh my help. The murmuring firs stretch forth<br />
Their myriad tiny crosses o&rsquo;er my head;<br />
Deep rolls an organ peal of thunder down<br />
The echoing vale, while clouds of incense float<br />
Before the great white altar set on high.<br />
So lift my heart, O God! and purify<br />
Its thought, that when I walk once more<br />
Thy minister amid the hurrying throng,<br />
One ray of sunlight from these golden days,<br />
One jewel from the mountain&rsquo;s regal brow,<br />
One cup of water from these springs of life,<br />
As tokens of thy beauty, I may bear<br />
To little ones who toil and long for rest.<br />
</p>

<p class='right'>
Affectionately, your son, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<span class="smcap">Rossiter</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>P. S. &nbsp; &nbsp;  I wish you knew that little &ldquo;Captain
Bess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She is one of the freshest, sweetest, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
unselfish girls I ever met. Hardly an hour passes
when she is not doing something for another&rsquo;s
comfort&mdash;adjusting old ladies&rsquo; shawls, reading
aloud, holding a tired child, or something of the
sort. In fact, she&rsquo;s the most like you, mother, of
anybody I ever met!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE GLACIER AND THE BEAR.</small></h2>


<p>Thus far the trip had been free from special
adventure beyond the ordinary happenings
in the course of an extraordinary journey. But
on the day following the departure from Banff, one
or two incidents occurred to break the monotony.
In the first place, there was Tom&rsquo;s affair with
the bear. But I must retrace my steps slightly,
before introducing Bruin.</p>

<p>The Excursion left Banff on the ninth morning
from Boston. The road now lay through a wilderness
of mighty hills. Onward and upward labored
the train, following the curves of mountain streams,
rattling in and out of tunnels, and creeping cautiously
over high trestles that creaked ominously
beneath the heavy cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>An observation car had been added, and here
the Percivals gathered, defying cinders and wintry
air. Far above the ravine through which the
stubborn Canadian Pacific had pushed its way,
they caught glimpses of snow-banks and glaciers,
which sent foaming torrents down the mountain-side
to join the Kicking-Horse River.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon they whirled around the
last dizzy curve, plunged into a snow-shed and out
again, and halted for the night beside a picturesque
little hotel in the very heart of the Selkirks.</p>

<p>Most of the party, including all the Percivals
except Tom, at once started along a forest path
for new wonders that were said to lie beyond.
Adelaide Selborne was too tired to go, and her
brother, having seen her comfortably resting in a
delightful little room in the hotel, hurried off to
join the rest.</p>

<p>Bessie, who had lingered behind a moment to
pick a handful of starry wild flowers, heard his
steps and turned to greet him with a bright look
of welcome. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she said,
in her frank way. &ldquo;You see, Randolph has gone
ahead with Pet Sibley, and Kittie is with Fred, so
I was kind of rear-guard, all alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a flower is that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Bess did not know, nor did her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so strange to find real wild wild-flowers,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;The little home violets
and mayflowers seem as tame as possible, compared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This forest has never been cut into,&rdquo; observed
Rossiter, as they sauntered along the narrow path.
The lofty trees, unscarred by axe or fire, towered
high above them; beside the path waved tall
ferns, starred here and there with boughs of the
white blossoms the little Captain had been picking.
An unseen stream, hastening downward
from far-away rocky heights, called softly through
the dim aisles.</p>

<p>After a mile or two of this thick wood, they
emerged upon rough, open ground, over which
they hurried, crossing a rude bridge which spanned
the torrent, and&mdash;there was the Great Glacier of
the Selkirks!</p>

<p>Bessie caught her breath, in the wonder and
grandeur of it.</p>

<p>For in comparison with this mighty stream of
ice, the glaciers of Europe are but frozen rivulets.
All the Swiss glaciers combined would not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the bulk of this monster, which covers thirty-eight
square miles of mountain-side with a moving
mass of ice five hundred feet thick. It is fitly
guarded by the solitary peak of &ldquo;Sir Donald,&rdquo;
whose top is lost in clouds eight thousand feet
above the valley.</p>

<p>They moved forward at length, climbing to the
edge of the glacier, and even mounting upon its
wrinkled back.</p>

<p>The advanced division of the party were already
quite at home with the big glacier, and sang their
gay songs as merrily as in the cosey &ldquo;Kamloops.&rdquo;
Fred and Randolph caught tin cupfuls of water
from an icy rill, and passed it to the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;that I could run up to
that next corner. The view would be splendid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kittie and the rest were just starting downward.
Mr. Selborne heard the Captain&rsquo;s remark,
and instantly was at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can do it and catch
up with the rest before they reach the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bessie, remembering her experience on Mount
Washington the year before, hesitated. But the
opportunity was too tempting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; she said hastily, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
please. Mother will worry about me if I stay up
here too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aided by a strong hand and arm, she clambered
up over the bowlders which lay along the mountain
slope in a confused mass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in the same tone of
triumph with which she had announced the success
of her fire on the shores of Nipissing, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
done it, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all, it was hardly worth the climb, for
the newly gained position only disclosed further
reaches, each promising a better outlook than the
next below. Rossiter glanced at the gathering
clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better start, Miss Bessie,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve got your breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If truth be told, Bess would have liked a little
longer rest; but she did not like to confess the
fatigue she felt. Besides, it was all down hill
now, so she held out her hand to her companion
without misgiving.</p>

<p>Before they had gone twenty yards, moving
cautiously down from bowlder to bowlder close
beside the ice, the air darkened and a fine rain
set in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/illo_054.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SHE CLAMBERED UP OVER THE BOWLDERS.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That will hurry the rest along,&rdquo; thought
Bessie, &ldquo;for they&rsquo;re already in the easy part of
the path, and they can run.&rdquo; But she said nothing
to distress her escort, who was already
troubled enough by the prospect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; he called suddenly, as he saw
Bessie spring over a mimic chasm, and barely miss
losing her balance on the further side. &ldquo;The
rain makes these rocks slippery, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a cry from Bess. She
sank down on a bowlder and lifted a white face
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ankle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve turned it, and it
hurts&mdash;dreadfully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help you, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was used to calling his sister that, you
know.</p>

<p>Bessie clung to his arm and tried to rise, but
sank back with a sharp little moan of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand.
You&rsquo;ll have&mdash;to go&mdash;and send somebody up&mdash;for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked so white that he thought she was
going to faint. But the little Captain had no idea
of giving way, if she could possibly help it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, please,&rdquo; she repeated, clutching the rough
rim of the rock to control herself.</p>

<p>Rossiter looked around, above, below. Not a
living creature was in sight. It was no use to call
for help, in that grim solitude. The rain drifted
across the black forest in gray columns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you leave me?&rdquo; pleaded Bessie again.</p>

<p>For reply he stooped, and lifting her in his arms
as if she were a child, began to pick his way downward,
slowly and cautiously.</p>

<p>At the end of half a dozen rods his breath was
gone. He placed his burden gently on the rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Selborne!&rdquo; cried Bess, with quivering
lips, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hurting you worse than me. Please&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he had rested enough, and just smiling for
reply, started along the path once more.</p>

<p>It was now raining heavily, and the traveled
way became more and more difficult to distinguish
in the gathering dusk. Bessie was a strong,
healthy young girl, and no light weight for a man
to carry.</p>

<p>The bridge was reached at last, and, narrow and
slippery as it was, stretching above a deep and
swift mountain stream, crossed in safety.</p>

<p>In a few moments they were at the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
forest; but Rossiter, little used in late years to
active sports or athletic exertion of any kind, felt
his strength leaving him. Great beads of perspiration
stood on his forehead, though the air
was bitter cold and the rain like ice.</p>

<p>He staggered and saved himself with difficulty
from falling, with Bessie in his arms. As he
placed her on the ground at the mossy foot of a
huge tree, he spoke to her, but she did not answer.
This time she had fainted in earnest.</p>


<p class='npara'>But it is time to return to the solitary representative
of the Percival family&mdash;or at least of the
younger portion of it&mdash;who found more attraction
at the base of the mountain than on its lofty and
ice-clad slopes. Mr. and Mrs. Percival had gone
to the hotel at once, and were glad to rest there
while the tireless young people &ldquo;explored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment the train had stopped and the passengers
began to pour out of the cars, Tom had
caught sight of an animal which by this time had
become pretty familiar to the travelers; namely, a
bear. At almost every station they had passed,
since leaving Winnipeg, was one or more of these
furry friends in captivity. Tom had made over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>tures
to all of them, sometimes barely escaping a
dangerous scratch or bite from the half-tamed
animals. The boy was just now an ardent naturalist,
in his impulsive way, and felt a great interest
in every strange creature on four legs&mdash;especially
bears.</p>

<p>Here was a good chance then, to cultivate
Bruin&rsquo;s acquaintance. While Tom was providing
himself with lumps of sugar at the hotel, his sisters
and the rest of the party started up the forest
path for the Glacier, as we have seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feed the black bear all you want to, but don&rsquo;t
fool with the cinnamon,&rdquo; called the clerk after
heedless Tom, who was already out of hearing.</p>

<p>Blackie was within a few rods of the hotel, and
Tom was soon having great fun with him, tossing
him lumps of sugar, and then holding them up
while the bear, who was only a half-grown cub,
stood clumsily on his hind legs and, supporting
himself against the boy&rsquo;s shoulders, stretched out
his little gray snout for the coveted sweets.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of their frolic when
Tom heard a chain rattle, up toward the woods.
Something was moving among the stumps&mdash;another
bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Pomp,&rdquo; shouted Tom, letting his
shaggy playmate down rather unceremoniously on
all fours. &ldquo;I must call on your cousin, over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pomp gazed at him with what Tom afterward
declared was a most meaning look in his twinkling
eyes, and galloped after him&mdash;only to be jerked
sprawling at the end of his tether. Then he sat
down, after the manner of his kind, and watched
the retreating form of the dispenser of sugar,
shaking his head gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save a lump for you and be back before
long, old fellow,&rdquo; called Tom encouragingly over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The cinnamon proved to be double the size of
his black neighbor. Instead of ambling up to his
visitor as the other had done, he retreated a pace
or two, and eyed him with such an unpleasant expression
that Tom stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Brownie,&rdquo; said he, in his most cajoling
tones. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some sugar for you.&rdquo; And he
tossed him a lump.</p>

<p>Cinnamon stretched out his paw, raked the lump
nearer, and bolted it. The taste was pleasing, and
he slowly advanced, dragging his heavy chain
after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Friendly enough,&rdquo; said Tom to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try him with a lump in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bear took it rather too greedily for the
comfort of the holder, but seemed in nowise inclined
to hostile measures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruin clumsily erected himself on his haunches,
and caught the sugar tossed to him.</p>

<p>Tom was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now put your paws up on my shoulders and get
it.&rdquo; He stood back to the animal and looked at
him over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Up came Cinnamon again, though rather sullenly,
and reaching both paws around Tom&rsquo;s neck
from behind, clasped them on the boy&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; cried Tom; &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll do, old
fellow. You&rsquo;re too heavy for me. Get down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low growl from a shaggy throat within three
inches of Tom&rsquo;s ear, was the only reply.</p>

<p>Tom held up his last lump of sugar, and while
his unwelcome comrade-in-arms was crunching it,
strove to wriggle himself from the bear&rsquo;s embrace.</p>

<p>It was of no use. The big, furry necklace only
clasped the more tightly, and the menacing growl
came again deeper than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s courage began to fail him. He
looked down at the two great paws on his chest,
armed with long, sharp claws. The bear&rsquo;s breath
came hot and fast on the back of his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo! help!&rdquo; shouted Tom desperately.</p>

<p>A savage snarl from the rear told him that a
repetition of the cry might be fatal to him. The
bear&rsquo;s patience began to give out. The growls
came nearer together, and more angrily. Every
moment Tom expected to feel those long, white
teeth in his scalp. To make matters worse, he
now seemed to remember the words the hotel
man had shouted after him, though he had paid
no attention to them at the time.</p>

<p>If Randolph and the rest would only come! It
was not like a fight with a wild bear. That would
be bad enough. But to be killed by a chained
beast, as a result of his own folly!</p>

<p>Both hope and courage were at the lowest ebb,
and the danger really very great, when Tom&rsquo;s hand
felt in the lining of his coat a hard bunch.</p>

<p>Cautiously, with trembling hands, he ripped out
the lining and extracted&mdash;a solitary lump of
sugar which had slipped down through a hole in
his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>He held it out at arms-length. After a fruitless
attempt to support himself with one paw and
reach the sugar with the other, the bear relaxed
his hold and dropped upon all fours.</p>

<p>To fling down the sugar and dart out of the
radius of that hard-trodden circle was the work of
a moment. Tom was safe!</p>

<p>The bear sprang after him, his little eyes
twinkling with rage; but the chain held fast, and
his late captive left him sprawling among the
stumps.</p>

<p>I am not sure that Tom would have told this
story at all, had not Randolph, one or two nights
later, caught sight of ten red marks on his
room-mate&rsquo;s breast. Then it all came out, as you
have it.</p>

<p>During the struggle with Bruin the sky had
darkened, and it now began to rain heavily.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br /><br />

<small>A KING&rsquo;S DAUGHTER IN A FREIGHT CAR.</small></h2>


<p>When Randolph and his party came rushing
with shouts of laughter from the
woods, they were joined by Tom, who was in an
unusually meek mood. Fred looked at him suspiciously,
but forbore to ask any questions.</p>

<p>The rain was coming down smartly, and all
hands gathered, panting and laughing, around the
generous fire in the little hotel office. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Bessie?&rdquo; asked Mr. Percival, as soon as he could
make his voice heard above the merry clamor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s just behind, with Mr. Selborne,&rdquo;
said Kittie. &ldquo;Randolph, look out of the door to
see if they are in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get dreadfully wet,&rdquo; remarked Pet.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they keep up?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Bess wanted to go up the glacier a little
farther. I saw her pointing to a big rock&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course he went,&rdquo; added Fred demurely.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival looked worried. His nephew reported
that the missing couple were not in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing darker every moment,&rdquo; he remarked
anxiously. &ldquo;I must go and look for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two strong young fellows who were employed
about the hotel went with him. Leaving the jolly
group around the fire, we will accompany the
relief party. Those who prefer cosiness and
warmth may stay behind!</p>

<p>The contrast was sharp, indeed, as Mr. Percival
stepped out-of-doors with his two companions.</p>

<p>The sky was filled with black clouds, that rolled
down the valley or hung in threatening masses
along the lofty mountain slopes.</p>

<p>As they entered the forest they had to step
carefully, lest they should stumble on some root
or stone, half-hidden in the darkness. Through
the boughs of the trees the rain dripped drearily.</p>

<p>They plodded on for over a mile, when they
caught sight of a flickering light, appearing and
vanishing, like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men from the hotel did not know what
to make of it, but Mr. Percival guessed the source
of the strange flame in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve built a fire,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Or,
at least, Bess has. I don&rsquo;t believe the minister
could do it, this wet night, if he tried!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could, though, as Captain Bess soon found
out, when he had stopped to rest in the edge of
the forest. About fifty feet from the path was
a huge bowlder draped with ferns, with the top
slightly overhanging its base.</p>

<p>To the shelter of this great rock the young
clergyman had borne his charge, placing her on a
dry cushion of moss and fir needles, where the
faintness soon left her, though the pain did not.
He had then busied himself in a wonderfully
handy way, collecting dry stuff from beneath the
bowlder, and in five minutes had a glorious fire
snapping and crackling, right in the midst of
the rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be a comfort to us,&rdquo; he remarked,
eying the blaze with great satisfaction, &ldquo;and will
signal the party they are sure to send out for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes!&rdquo; cried Bess. And then, of course,
she had to tell him, often pausing as the sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
twinges of pain shot more and more fiercely
through her ankle, all about the lost party in
Maine, and the exploit which had earned for her
the title of Captain.</p>

<p>She had hardly finished her story when a shout
was heard, and presently the relief party came
hurrying into the firelit space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear? Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Percival, hastily kneeling down beside his
daughter and throwing his arms around her. He
had not realized until that moment how deeply
anxious he had been during that dismal walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a little, father. It&rsquo;s just my ankle. I
turned it on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Selborne&mdash;carried me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father turned and clasped the young man&rsquo;s
hand, saying simply, &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo; But each
of the men knew the already strong friendship
between them was deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for getting home,&rdquo; called out Rossiter.
&ldquo;Too bad to leave the fire, though, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can spend the night here if you like,&rdquo;
laughed Bess, rising painfully and clinging to her
father&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>It was clear that she could not walk a step.</p>

<p>The fire was cared for; then the two sturdy
young backwoodsmen made an arm-chair with
their hands and wrists, and tramped off with Bess
between them as easily as if she were a kitten.</p>

<p>Very slowly though, and with great skill and
care, feeling the ground carefully with their feet
at every step. So they made their way back to
the hotel, where there was a general jubilee over
their return.</p>

<p>The train was side-tracked that night, close by
the station. It was great fun for the young people
to climb aboard, and, after a good-night sing,
clamber into their berths to be lulled to sleep, not
by the rumble of iron wheels, but the rushing
waters of the Illicilliwaet.</p>

<p>Bessie, it should be said, was carried to the cars
by her father. There was a physician in the
party, and by his advice the strained ankle received
such wise and timely treatment that by
bed-time it was far less painful. In two or three
days, the doctor said, she could use it again,
though care would be necessary for a fortnight
or more.</p>

<p>On the following morning the rain was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
falling, but by ten o&rsquo;clock the sky brightened a
little, and the Percivals, with the exception of
Bess, set out for a walk down the track. There
was a long snow shed not far away, from which
Tom hoped to get a good operating field for his
kodak.</p>

<p>Hardly had they clambered to the top of the
structure and &ldquo;pressed the button&rdquo; once, when a
flying gust of rain, backed by a portentous black
cloud, sent them flying down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come in under the shed,&rdquo; proposed Tom.
This, however, was so cold and damp, that Fred
and Randolph, seeing some detached freight cars,
a few rods up the track, started off to explore for
a better shelter.</p>

<p>A minute or two later they were beckoning and
shouting to the rest of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run for it!&rdquo; they called out. &ldquo;Plenty of
room here for all hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pet distanced the other girls, and was mounting
a short flight of steps to the end of the nearest
freight car, when what was her surprise to be met
at the door by a fresh-faced, modest-looking young
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
haven&rsquo;t got wet,&rdquo; and led the way to the interior
of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a fairy story,&rdquo; whispered Pet to
Kittie, as the latter scrambled up the steps. &ldquo;Is
she a princess in disguise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only so far as she is a true &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;
in her hospitality,&rdquo; said Mr. Percival, catching
Pet&rsquo;s question, and replying in the same tone.</p>

<p>In trooped the excursionists, a dozen or more of
them, all looking about them in amazement.</p>

<p>The car was divided into two compartments:
one small one for a sleeping-room, the larger&mdash;in
which the strangers were received&mdash;serving as
kitchen and &ldquo;living room.&rdquo; A fire snapped and
purred comfortably in the stove; before the tiny
windows (against which the rain was now dashing
in good earnest) were draped red curtains, and on
the sill were pots of geranium and ivy.</p>

<p>Cheerful prints hung upon the walls, and altogether
the old freight car, settled down at last
after its many wanderings, was as cosey a home as
heart could desire.</p>

<p>The bright little hostess proudly exhibited a
photograph of her husband, a manly-looking fellow,
and one or two other views which comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
her art treasures. Her modest and quiet demeanor
would have done credit to a high-bred
lady, and none of the Percivals, I think, will soon
forget their hearty welcome, or the warm good-by
with which she sped her parting guests.</p>

<p>Before leaving, it should be added, Randolph
made the rounds of the car, and left a substantial
remembrance in the hands of this far away &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Daughter.&rdquo; But the train was ready, and the old
locomotive in a flurried way calling her brood of
one hundred chickens together.</p>

<p>Away went the cars once more, curving around
the mountain spurs, crossing torrents, clinging
to the rugged slopes of granite; now descending
to the level of the Columbia, now climbing again to
Eagle Pass, ever westward toward the Pacific.</p>

<p>That night, it should be mentioned, they passed
through Kamloops, not a remarkable town in
itself, but ever memorable from the fact that it
gave its name to the car in which the Percivals
crossed the Continent. A great celebration had
been planned for the occasion; but as everybody
was asleep at the time (about two in the morning),
it didn&rsquo;t come off. The titles of all the cars had
by this time become very familiar, and the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
spoke of calling on a friend in the &ldquo;Missanabie,&rdquo;
or stepping back to the &ldquo;Nepigon,&rdquo; as they would
mention Newbury Street or Louisburg Square.</p>

<p>One morning they found themselves rolling
along the high bank of the Fraser River, famous
in the history of the gold fever of 1849; its
muddy waters, laden with the wealth of empires,
rushing past the train toward the ocean. On the
shore Chinamen and Indians could be seen,
dredging for gold, or fishing for salmon.</p>

<p>On the further side of the river ran the old
Government wagon road, curiously built and
buttressed with logs in many places, leading to
the Cariboo gold country.</p>

<p>At Yale&mdash;an outfitting point for runners and
ranchmen&mdash;there was a stop to water the engine.
Children crowded up to the cars with small baskets
of berries and nosegays.</p>

<p>Randolph brought in to Bessie&mdash;who was
patiently bearing her lameness&mdash;a bunch of
exquisite white pansies, a strange product for this
wild, half-civilized country.</p>

<p>It was high noon when the conductor opened
the door of the car and shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vancouver! Vancouver!&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br /><br />

<small>VICTORIA AND &ldquo;THE QUEEN.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Vancouver,&rdquo; began Mr. Percival that
afternoon, &ldquo;is the baby city of the
Northwest.&rdquo; They were in a barouche, five of
them, driving through Stanley Park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo; asked his
nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s less than six years old, Randolph.
Yet it has a population of over fifteen thousand.
Six years ago to-day there was a dense forest
where these great brick and stone buildings now
stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it burned once, father?&rdquo; asked Tom,
anxious to show the result of his reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it was two months old,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Percival, &ldquo;every house but one was destroyed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fire. Now it is one of the most prosperous and
well-managed cities in the Dominion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed in the Canadian Pacific time-tables,&rdquo;
put in Fred, &ldquo;that there is a regular line of
steamers running from Vancouver to Japan and
China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of trees are these, driver?&rdquo; asked
Randolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas fir and cedar, mostly,&rdquo; said the
driver, who proved to be a Vermont man. &ldquo;The
big ones are cedar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big ones they were, truly; with trunks, or, in
some cases, mere stumps, twenty to forty feet in
diameter. The driver explained that in the early
days of the city these magnificent trees were often
ruthlessly destroyed, merely to get them out of
the way. At last the city authorities took the
matter in hand, and preserved a large tract of forest
land, now called Stanley Park, for the permanent
enjoyment of the people.</p>

<p>The road was a beautiful one, and in some places
the travelers could catch glimpses of the broad
Pacific, true to its name, breaking in slow, gentle
waves on the beach just below.</p>

<p>At sunset the whole party boarded the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<i>Islander</i>, and the six hours&rsquo; moonlight sail that
followed was more like fairy-land than anything
they had yet seen.</p>

<p>The calm waters of the Gulf of Georgia, silvered
and peaceful in the midsummer moonlight, stretched
away on every side, broken only by wooded islands
and the jutting promontories of Vancouver&rsquo;s;
while far away to the southwest Mount Baker&rsquo;s
snowy peak rose, pale and serene, among the
clouds.</p>

<p>The young people sang all their &ldquo;Kamloops&rdquo;
songs over and over, the music adding the one
needful touch to the scene.</p>

<p>On arriving at the wharf in Victoria, they were
glad to make their way through the noisy crowd
of hackmen to the carriages reserved for their
party, and take refuge in the Driard, where they
were to rest for the next two days.</p>


<p class='npara'>&ldquo;Have you a piece of string, pa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a simple, kindly-faced little woman who
asked the question, looking up to her husband, the
gardener.</p>

<p>Randolph and Pet had taken a long walk through
the streets of the city of Victoria, and out among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the scattered houses and fields that border the
way. Presently they reached a pretty cottage
almost hidden from sight by a mass of climbing
honeysuckle. In the garden beside it grew a profusion
of old-fashioned flowers&mdash;stocks, sweet
mignonette, geraniums, and many others.</p>

<p>A bed of lovely pansies attracted Pet&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you suppose they would sell some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see,&rdquo; and sure enough, there was
&ldquo;Ma&rdquo; upon the little piazza, beaming with hospitality
and pleasure at the approach of visitors.</p>

<p>She set to work at once gathering pansies, and
while she arranged her nosegay, the two Bostonians
talked with her husband, who, it seemed, was an
Englishman, and earned his living from his garden,
which he was just watering. He took especial
pride in his fuchsias, which grew in lovely
abundance and variety all around his door. Sweet
peas were there, too, the vines nearly as high as
your head, all covered with dainty &ldquo;painted ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo; having furnished the string, Randolph
received (for twenty cents) a great bunch of
pansies. The little saleswoman then added a
stalk of gillyflower and a scarlet geranium for
buttonholes, and with a smiling face said good-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The pansies were soon transferred, Pet keeping
the gillyflower in her dress until she was out of
sight, &ldquo;so as not to hurt Ma&rsquo;s feelings,&rdquo; and then
replacing it by the pretty &ldquo;thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later in the day they visited the Chinese quarter
of the city, in company with Tom and his inseparable
kodak.</p>

<p>There was a delightful baby in one of the shops,
and Tom begged hard to be allowed to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; it,
but the parents said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and could not be moved
to relent, though they did offer the photographer
a live gold-fish as some compensation for the
refused privilege.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival also took his charges to the splendid
naval station of Esquimault, where the Pacific
Squadron of English ships were lying at anchor.</p>

<p>The Percivals hired a man (from Connecticut)
to row them out in a boat to the great <i>War
Spite</i> over which they were shown by a smart
British sailor boy in blue. They were deeply
interested in her great cannon, throwing a three
hundred pound ball, her massive machinery, and
her vicious-looking steel torpedoes, which run
under water, and are guided by an electric wire
connected with the ship. &ldquo;You can guess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
size of the vessel,&rdquo; wrote Randolph to a friend
that night, &ldquo;when you learn that six hundred men
are now quartered in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at dusk, on the second day in Victoria,
they went on board the good ship <i>Queen</i>, which
was waiting to bear them northward to the rugged
coast, the island-studded gulfs and bays, and the
eternal ice-rivers of Alaska.</p>

<p>For a long time that evening they walked the
deck, Kittie pacing side by side with Fred Seacomb,
Randolph telling Pet of his Freshman
struggles and triumphs and pleasures at Harvard,
Tom talking eagerly with his father, whose arm
he took as they went to and fro, or paused to look
out over the quiet waters, or the twinkling lights
of Victoria. Adelaide, Bess, Rossiter and Mrs.
Percival formed a cosey group reclining in their
steamer-chairs in the shelter of the staterooms
which they were to occupy that night.</p>

<p>At six the next morning the passengers felt the
first thrill which told that the <i>Queen</i> had begun
her voyage. Hastily they dressed, and emerged
one by one from their staterooms, to gain every
moment of this enchanted day.</p>

<p>The voyage northward led through narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
channels, where one could almost toss a biscuit
ashore on either side; across open stretches of the
blue Pacific, whose great waves rocked them
gently; along the base of lofty mountains, with
wild, untraveled forests growing on the water&rsquo;s
very edge.</p>

<p>Soon they began to see Indian encampments,
or solitary natives, paddling their queer-shaped,
dug-out canoes. Whales rose solemnly and
spouted with deep sighs. Porpoises showed their
glistening backs above water, raced beside the
ship, and threw themselves out into the sunlight.
Eagles winged their way from shore to shore, and
ducks paddled merrily in every small bay. On
masses of floating timber hovered snow-gulls,
their beautiful wings lifting and closing as their
rafts were rocked in the steamer&rsquo;s wake.</p>

<p>The second day on board was Sunday. There
was an Episcopal service in the saloon in the
forenoon, nearly all the excursionists assembling
and joining in the hymns. The afternoon passed
quietly, many of the passengers writing letters to
home friends, some reading, some walking or
reclining in steamer-chairs on deck.</p>

<p>In the evening the Percivals gathered for a sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in a sheltered place near the wheel-house. Never
before did the old church tunes sound so sweetly.
At nine o&rsquo;clock the sky was all golden with sunset
colors, reflected in the smooth waters of the Sound.</p>

<p>Just before that hour there had been a little
silence. When two bells were struck, Mr. Percival
was seen to smile with a curious expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, father?&rdquo; asked Bess, who was
nestling close to his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it reminded me first of church bells, and
then of an odd little affair in a Maine town, not
far from your uncle&rsquo;s farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! tell us about it,&rdquo; cried two or three
voices at once. &ldquo;A story, a story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should hardly like to turn this pleasant
little Sunday evening meeting into a story-telling
circle,&rdquo; said Mr. Percival after a moment&rsquo;s pause;
&ldquo;but as it&rsquo;s all about a church, and is a sort of
Christmas story, perhaps it will do no harm. Are
you warm enough, Bessie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty, father,&rdquo; replied the little Captain.
&ldquo;Do give us the story. I&rsquo;ve heard you tell it
before, but I always did like to see you tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You must fancy, as you read the next few
pages, that you are on the steamer, with collar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
turned up, or shawl muffled about your shoulders.
Just in front of you is the story-teller, a man of
about sixty, with iron-gray hair and full beard,
kindly eyes and broad shoulders. His right arm
is thrown over Bessie&rsquo;s shoulder as she leans
against him, the little injured foot on a camp-stool
before her. Mr. Selborne, quiet and grave, with
rather a thin face, but fine dark eyes and firm
mouth under a brown mustache, comes next.
Kittie and Tom are seated on the bench that runs
around the whole deck, their backs to the rail.
Pet is in a steamer-chair, and Randolph, Adelaide
and Mrs. Percival are grouped together, completing
the circle. Half a dozen other friends have
drawn near, and are comfortably reclining, sitting
or standing just behind Pet.</p>

<p>A radiant path leads over the waters toward the
west, where the wooded islands throw their dark,
rugged summits against the sky.</p>

<p>The muffled splashing of the steamer&rsquo;s great
wheels, mingled with the low whispers of wind
and sea, fill the pauses of the speaker&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>Overhead a brood of ocean fowl, a flock of
slender-winged gulls, or a single eagle sweep
silently across the bright field of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be impossible, as there was no shorthand
writer present, to give the narrative that followed
in Mr. Percival&rsquo;s exact words; or to reproduce
the kindly twinkle of his eye as he dwelt
upon the more humorous phases of it. These you
must yourself supply as you read.</p>


<h4>THE STORY OF THE CRACKED BELL.</h4>

<p>There was no doubt whatever of its melancholy
condition. Cracked it was, and cracked it had
been for the last two years. Just how the crack
came there, nobody knew. It was, indeed, a tiny
flaw, long ago covered by green rust, and apparently
as harmless as the veriest thread or a wisp
of straw, lodging for a moment on the old bell&rsquo;s
brazen sides. But when the clapper began to
swing, and gave one timid touch to the smooth
inner surface of its small cell, the flaw made itself
known, and as the strokes grew louder and angrier,
the dissonance so clattered and battered against
the ears of the parish, that after two years&rsquo; patient
endurance of this infliction (which they considered
a direct discipline, to humble their pride over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
new coat of white paint on the little church), one
small, nervous sister rose in prayer meeting and
begged that the bell be left quiet, or at least
muffled for one day, as it disturbed her daughter,
whom all the village knew to be suffering from
consumption.</p>

<p>Emboldened by this declaration of war, a deacon
declared that it was an insult to religion and its
founder, to ring such a bell. It was the laughing-stock
of the village, he added, and its flat discords
were but a signal for derision on the part of every
scoffer and backslider in the parish.</p>

<p>Other evidence of convincing character was
given by various members of the congregation;
the bell was tried, condemned and sentenced; and
more than one face showed its relief as good old
Dr. Manson, the pastor, instructed the sexton publicly
to omit the customary call to services on the
following Sabbath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he further said, looking around
gravely on his people, &ldquo;that you will all make
more than usual effort to be in your pews
promptly at half-past ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time the members of the First Congregational
Society of North Penfield were notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ably
and commendably prompt in their attendance
upon all services. They were so afraid that they
should be late that they arrived at the meeting-house
a good while before the opening hymn.
Dr. Manson was gratified, the village wits were
put down, and the old bell hung peacefully in the
belfry over the attentive worshipers, as silent as
they. Snow and rain painted its surface with
vivid tints, and the swallows learned that they
could perch upon it without danger of its being
jerked away from their slender feet.</p>

<p>There was no other meeting-house in the town,
and as the nearest railroad was miles away, the
sound of a clear-toned bell floating down from the
summer sky, or sending its sweet echoes vibrating
through a wintry twilight in an oft-repeated mellow
call to prayers, was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Gradually the congregation fell into the habit of
dropping in of a Sunday morning while the choir
were singing the voluntary, or remaining in the
vestibule where, behind the closed doors, they
had a bit of gossip while they waited for the rustle
within which announced the completion of the
pastor&rsquo;s long opening prayer. It became a rare
occurrence for all to be actually settled in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
pews when the text was given out. The same
tardiness was noticeable in the Friday evening
meetings; and, odd to say, a certain spirit of indolence
seemed to creep over the services themselves.</p>

<p>Whereas in former days the farmers and their
wives were wont to come bustling briskly into the
vestry while the bell was ringing, and the cheerful
hum of voices arose in the informal handshaking
&ldquo;before meeting,&rdquo; soon quieting and then blending
joyously in the stirring strains of &ldquo;How Firm
a Foundation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Onward, Christian Soldier,&rdquo;
followed by one brief, earnest prayer or exhortation
after another, in quick succession, in these
later days it was quite different. It was quite
difficult to carry the first hymn through, as there
were rarely enough good singers present to sustain
the air. Now it was the pianist who was late,
now the broad-shouldered mill-owner, whose rich
bass was indeed a &ldquo;firm foundation&rdquo; for all timid
sopranos and altos; now the young man who
could sing any part with perfect confidence, and
often did wander over all four in the course of a
single verse, lending a helping hand, so to speak,
wherever it was needed.</p>

<p>The halting and dispirited hymn made the mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>bers
self-distrustful and melancholy at the outset.
There were long pauses during which all the
sluggish or tired-out brothers and sisters nodded
in the heated room, and the sensitive and nervous
clutched shawl fringes and coat buttons in
agonized fidgets. The meetings became so dull
and heavy that slight excuses were sufficient to
detain easy-going members at home, especially the
young people. It was a rare sight now to see
bright eyes and rosy cheeks in the room. The
members discussed the dismal state of affairs,
which was only too plain, and laid the blame on
the poor old minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His sermons haven&rsquo;t the power they had once,
Brother Stimpson,&rdquo; remarked Deacon Fairweather,
shaking his head sadly, as they trudged home
from afternoon service one hot Sunday in August.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wantin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t jestly know
what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t pussonal enough. You want to be
pussonal to do any good in a parish. There&rsquo;s
Squire Radbourne, now. Everybody knows he
sets up Sunday evenin&rsquo;s and works on his law
papers. I say there ought to be a reg&rsquo;lar downright
discourse on Sabbath breaki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>n&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s so, thet&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented the deacon.
&ldquo;And Brother Langworth hasn&rsquo;t been nigh
evenin&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; for mor&rsquo;n six weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From one faulty member to another they wandered;
forgetting, as they jogged along the
familiar path side by side, talking eagerly, the
banks of golden-rod beside them, the blue sky and
fleecy clouds above, the blue hills in the distance,
and all the glory and brightness of the blessed
summer day.</p>

<p>The next morning, North Penfield experienced
a shock. The white-haired pastor, overcome by
extra labor, increasing cares, the feebleness of age,
or a combination of all these causes, had sunk
down upon his bed helplessly, on his return from
the little white meeting-house the afternoon before,
never to rise again until he should leave
behind him the weary earth-garments that now
but hindered his slow and painful steps.</p>

<p>The townspeople were greatly concerned, for
the old man was dearly loved by young and old.
Those who of late had criticised now remembered
Dr. Manson&rsquo;s palmy days, when teams came driving
in from Penfield Center, &ldquo;The Hollow,&rdquo; and
two or three other adjoining settlements, to listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to the impassioned discourses of the young
clergyman.</p>

<p>A meeting of the committee was called at once,
to consider the affairs of the bereft church&mdash;for
bereft they felt it to be&mdash;and take steps for an
immediate supply during the vacancy of the pulpit.
Two months later Dr. Manson passed peacefully
away, and there was one more mound in the
little churchyard.</p>

<p>The snows of early December already lay deep
on road and field before the North Penfield Parish,
in a regularly called and organized meeting, was
given to understand that a new minister was settled.
Half a dozen candidates had preached to
the people, but only one had met with favor.</p>

<p>Harold Olsen was a Norwegian by parentage,
though born in America. Tall and straight as
the pines of the Norseland, with clear, flashing
blue eyes and honest, winning smile, the congregation
began to love him before he was half
through his first sermon. His sweet-faced little
wife made friends with a dozen people between
services; by nightfall the question was practically
settled, and so was the Rev. Harold Olsen, &ldquo;the
new minister,&rdquo; as he was called for years afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the second week in December,
Harold ascended the pulpit stairs of the
North Penfield meeting-house, feeling very humble
and very thankful in the face of his new duties.
He loved his work, his people, his wife and his
God; and here he was, with them all at once.</p>

<p>Sleigh bells jingled merrily outside the door;
one family after another came trooping in, muffled
to the ears, and moved demurely up the central or
side aisles to their high-backed pews.</p>

<p>The sunlight found its way in under the old-fashioned
fan-shaped blinds at the tops of the high
windows, and rested upon gray hair and brown,
on figures bowed with grief and age, on restless,
eager children, on the pulpit itself, and finally
upon the golden-edged leaves of the old Bible.</p>

<p>Still the people came in. A hymn was given
out and sung. While Harold was lifting his soul
to Heaven on the wings of his prayer, he could not
help hearing the noise of heavy boots in the meeting-house
entry, stamping the snow. His fervent
&ldquo;Amen&rdquo; was the signal for a draft of cold air
from the doors, followed by a dozen late comers.</p>

<p>After the sermon, which was so simple and
straightforward that it went directly to the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of the people, he was eager to confer with his
deacons for a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bell didn&rsquo;t ring this morning, Brother
Fairweather. What was the matter?&rdquo; he asked,
after a warm hand-grasp all round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the fact is, sir, there ain&rsquo;t no bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, none to speak of,&rdquo; put in Deacon
Stimpson apologetically. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bell up
there, but it got so cracked an&rsquo; out o&rsquo; tune that
nobody could stan&rsquo; it, sick or well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rev. Harold Olsen&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you gone without this unfortunate
bell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! a matter o&rsquo; two or three years, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weddings, funerals, and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; reluctantly, &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve so. I did
feel bad when we follored the minister to his grave
without any tollin&rsquo;&mdash;he was master fond o&rsquo; hearing
that bell, fust along&mdash;but there, it couldn&rsquo;t
be helped. Public opinion was against that &rsquo;ere
particular bell, and we jes&rsquo; got laughed at, ringin&rsquo;
it. So we stopped, and here we be, without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Olsen&rsquo;s blue eyes sparkled again as he
caught his little wife&rsquo;s glance, half-amused, half-pained.
He changed the subject, and went among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
his parishioners, inquiring kindly for the absent
ones, and making new friends.</p>

<p>At a quarter before three (the hour for afternoon
service) he entered the meeting-house again.
The sexton was asleep in one of the pews. He
was roused by a summons so startling that a repetition
was necessary before he could comprehend
its import.</p>

<p>&ldquo;R-ring the bell!&rdquo; he gasped incredulously.
&ldquo;W-why, sir, it hasn&rsquo;t been rung for&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mr. Bedlow,&rdquo; interrupted Harold,
with his pleasant smile. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it to-day, just
for a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harold had attended one or two prayer meetings,
as well as Sunday services, and&mdash;had an
idea.</p>

<p>On reaching the entry, the sexton shivered in
the cold air, and pointed helplessly to a hole in the
ceiling, through which the bell rope was intended
to play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put it up inside out of the way, so&rsquo;s the boys
couldn&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he chattered. &ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t you
think, sir, we&rsquo;d better wait till&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>But it was no use to talk to empty air. The
new minister had gone, and presently returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with a long, heavy bench, which he handled as
easily as if it were a lady&rsquo;s work-basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just steady it a bit,&rdquo; he asked; and Mr. Bedlow,
with conscientious misgivings as to the propriety
of his assisting at a gymnastic performance
on Sunday, did as he was bid.</p>

<p>Up went the minister like a cat; and presently
down came the knotted end of the rope. &ldquo;Now,
let&rsquo;s have a good, hearty pull, Mr. Bedlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sexton grasped the rope and pulled. There
was one frightened, discordant outcry from the
astonished bell; and there stood poor Mr. Bedlow
with about three yards of detached rope in his
hands. It had broken just above the point where
it passed through the flooring over his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; expostulated the sexton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Dick!&rdquo; called Mr. Olsen, to a bright-faced
little fellow who had put his head in at the
door and was regarding these unwonted proceedings
with round-eyed astonishment; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you
run over to my house and ask my wife for that
long piece of clothes-line that hangs up in the
kitchen closet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was gone like a flash, his curiosity excited
to the highest pitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he want it for?&rdquo; asked pretty
Olga Olsen, hurrying to produce the required
article.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; panted Dick. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got Mr.
Bedlow&mdash;in the entry&mdash;an&rsquo; he sent for a rope,
double quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which bewildering statement he tore out
of the house and back to the church.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the population of North Penfield
were astounded by hearing a long-silent, but
only too familiar voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that old cracked bell!&rdquo; exclaimed half a
hundred voices at once, in as many families. &ldquo;Do
let&rsquo;s go to meetin&rsquo; an&rsquo; see what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The afternoon&rsquo;s congregation was, in fact, even
larger than the morning&rsquo;s. Harold noted it with
quiet satisfaction, and gave out as his text the
first verse of the sixty-sixth Psalm.</p>

<p>At the close of his brief sermon he paused a
moment, then referred to the subject in all their
thoughts, speaking in no flippant or jesting tone,
but in a manner that showed how sacredly important
he considered the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been pained to notice,&rdquo; he said gravely,
&ldquo;the tardiness with which we begin our meetings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
It is perfectly natural that we should be late, when
there is no general call, such as we have been accustomed
to hear from childhood. I do not blame
anybody in the least. I do believe that we have
all grown into a certain sluggishness, both physical
and spiritual, in our assembling together, as
a direct consequence of the omission of those
chimes which to us and our fathers have always
spoken but one blessed word&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Come!</i>&rsquo; I believe,&rdquo;
he continued, looking about over the kindly
faces before him, &ldquo;I believe you agree with me
that something should be done. Don&rsquo;t think me
too hasty or presuming in my new pastorate, if I
add that it seems to me vitally important to take
action at once. Our bell is not musical, it is true,
but its tones, cracked and unmelodious as they
are, will serve to remind us of our church home,
its duties and its pleasures. On Tuesday evening
we will hold a special meeting in this house to
consider the question of purchasing a new bell, to
take the place of the old. The Prudential Committee,
and all who are interested in the subject
are urged to be present. Let us pray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a wonderful &ldquo;season,&rdquo; that Tuesday
evening conference. The cracked bell did its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
quavering best for a full twenty minutes before
the hour appointed, to call the people together;
and no appeal could have been more irresistible.</p>

<p>Two thirds of the sum required was raised that
night. For ten days more the old bell rang on
every possible occasion, until it became an accusing
voice of conscience to the parish. Prayer
meetings once more began sharp on the hour,
and proceeded with old-time vigor. The interest
spread until a real revival was in progress before
the North Penfield Society were fairly aware of
the change. Still the &ldquo;bell fund&rdquo; lacked fifty
dollars of completion.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twentieth of December,
in the midst of a furious storm, a knock was heard
at the parsonage, and lo, at the hastily opened
door stood Squire Radbourne, powdered with
snowflakes, and beaming like a veritable Santa
Claus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t feel easy,&rdquo; he announced, after he
had been relieved of coat and furs, and seated before
the blazing fire, &ldquo;to have next Sunday go by
without a new bell on the meeting-house. We
must have some good hearty chimes on that morning,
sure; it&rsquo;s the twenty-fifth, you know. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
here&rsquo;s a little Christmas present to the parish&mdash;or
the Lord, either way you want to put it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crisp fifty dollar note he laid down before
the delighted couple was all that was needed.</p>

<p>Harold made a quick calculation&mdash;he had already
selected a bell at a foundry a hundred miles
away&mdash;and sitting down at his desk, wrote rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mail your letter,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
right on my way&mdash;or near enough. Let&rsquo;s get it
off to-night, to save time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And away he trudged again, through the deepening
drifts and the blur of the white storm.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, after all the village people
were supposed to be abed and asleep, two dark
figures might have been seen moving to and fro
in the old meeting-house, with a lantern. After
some irregular movements in the entry, the light
appeared in the belfry, and a little later, one
queer, flat, brassy note, uncommonly like the voice
of the cracked bell, rang out on the night air.
Then there was absolute silence; and before long
the meeting-house was locked up and left to itself
again on Christmas Eve&mdash;alone, with the wonder-secret
of a new song in its faithful heart, waiting
to break forth in praise of God at dawn of day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>How the people started that fair Christmas
morning, as the sweet, silvery notes fell on their
ears! They hastened to the church; they pointed
to the belfry where the bell swung to and fro in a
joyous call of &ldquo;<i>Come! come! come! come!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>They listened in rapt silence, and some could
not restrain their sobs, while others with grateful
tears in their eyes looked upon the old, rusty,
cracked bell that rested, silent, on the church floor;
and as they looked, and even passed their hands
lovingly over its worn sides, they thanked God for
its faithful service and the good work it had
wrought&mdash;and for the glad hopes that filled that
blessed Christmas Day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br /><br />

<small>SOLOMON BARANOV.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;All ashore!&rdquo; sung out Tom as the <i>Queen</i>
touched the wharf at Fort Wrangell, at
nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning. &ldquo;Come on, all of
you. We have four hours here, the captain says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mounting the rail for a jump, the boy brought
upon himself a sharp rebuke from the officer; but
the ship was soon safely moored and the gangplank
run down to the wharf.</p>

<p>The excursionists straggled ashore in twos and
threes, and began an eager inspection of their
first Alaskan town.</p>

<p>The Percivals and their friends stroll down
the single street of the village, which borders the
shore with a row of low wooden houses.</p>

<p>Here are three or four squaws in gaudy blankets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
crouching on a little wooden platform in front of
their hut. Their favorite position is that of a seal,
or a pussy cat&mdash;half-reclining, face downward.
Spread out on the platform are baskets made of
cedar-root, fiber and bark; carved wooden knives
and forks; spoons of horn; little stone images,
silver bracelets, and other curiosities of home
manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival purchased one or two of these
trinkets for friends at home, and continued his
walk, followed by a pack of yelping dogs.</p>

<p>A singular object now came in view&mdash;a pole
about twenty feet tall and two feet in diameter,
carved in strange and fantastic shapes. There
were the figures of a bear, a raven, a fish and a
frog, with a grotesque human head at the top of
all. This was one of the famous &ldquo;totem poles,&rdquo;
which indicate the tribe to which the owner
belongs, and generally display an image of one
or more ancestors. A thousand good American
dollars could hardly purchase this ugly, worn,
weather-beaten old pole from the natives who live
in squalid poverty in the log hut behind it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/illo_100.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TOTEM POLES AT FORT WRANGELL.</div>
</div>

<p>Here was another totem pole belonging to the
chief of the Bear tribe. It had simply the figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>of a crouching bear on the top, with prints of his
feet carved in the wood leading up to it. Another
had a raven in the same way. There was a huge
wooden wolf set on the tomb of a prominent
member of the &ldquo;Wolves&rdquo;&mdash;once a powerful
Alaskan tribe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they would let us go inside
their house?&rdquo; whispered Adelaide to her brother,
glancing timidly in at one of the open front doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he replied, and soon returned, laughing.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t object in the least,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They seem used to visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Entering the door, the party found themselves
in a large square room, which comprised the whole
interior of the house. The floor was of earth,
beaten hard, but a wooden platform, raised about
two feet, ran around three sides. In the exact
center was a smouldering fire of logs, the smoke
finding its way out through a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you sleep?&rdquo; asked Rossiter.</p>

<p>Only one of the half-dozen natives who were
seated around the fire could understand English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bed,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a heap of blankets
lying on the raised platform in one corner
of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>On the dingy walls of the little hut there hung a
colored print of the Saviour&rsquo;s face. All around
were the strange heathen carvings and rude implements
of the Alaskan native. The four posts which
supported the roof were &ldquo;totems,&rdquo; representing in
hideous caricature the tribe to which the inhabitants
of the hut belonged. The natives themselves,
slow of movement and speech, their dull
eyes hardly glancing at the strangers, were grouped
on the raised margin of the floor.</p>

<p>I said the faces were dull. There was one
exception. A young mother bent over a solemn
brown baby who lay, round-eyed and contented, in
her lap. The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone with mother-love;
her dark hand was gentle as she smoothed Baby&rsquo;s
tumbled little blanket, and looked up shyly and
proudly at the new-comers.</p>

<p>The child in its mother&rsquo;s bosom; the Christ
face upon the wall: these were the two points of
light in that shadowy home. Christ, who came as
a little child to Bethlehem, had sent a baby to
Fort Wrangell, and a thought, vague and unformed
though it was, of the Saviour whose face looked
down upon the little group, from its rude frame
upon the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls waved their hands to the round little
brown berry of a baby, and the mother laughed
and looked pleased, just as a New England mother
would. Mr. Selborne left in her hand a silver
coin&mdash;&ldquo;two bits,&rdquo; everybody in Alaska called a
quarter&mdash;and said good-by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tribe do they belong to?&rdquo; asked
Randolph, as they emerged from the gloomy hut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stickeen,&rdquo; promptly replied Tom. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
give &rsquo;em a sing.&rdquo; And sing they did, until the
solemn faces of the natives gathering about them
on the beach, actually relaxed into the semblance
of a smile.</p>

<p>Reaching the steamer once more, they displayed
their treasures before Bess, who could not yet
quite venture on a long walk.</p>

<p>There were toy paddles, with ravens&rsquo; and bears&rsquo;
heads painted in red and black; horn spoons, dark
and light, with finely carved profiles on the handle;
great rough garnets, of which Tom had purchased
half a handful for a song, and many other oddities.
Of course the kodak army had been busy, but the
results could not yet be seen. Many a Stickeen
portrait and ugly totem lay snugly hidden in
those black leather boxes, to be &ldquo;developed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>&rdquo;
printed and laughed over in gay city parlors the
coming winter.</p>

<p>Just as the boat cast off her moorings, an
Indian, fantastically dressed, appeared on the
wharf, and gave a dance for the benefit of the
departing passengers, who threw down bits of
silver as the <i>Queen</i> once more started on her
course.</p>

<p>As the heart of the great ship began to throb
and she swung slowly out toward the sea, one tall,
quiet-faced man stood upon the old wharf among
the Indians, silently watching the departure of all
that meant home and friends. He waved his
hand and lifted his hat to some one on deck,
then turned gravely, and with firm step walked
back toward the straggling row of huts which
sheltered the poor, degraded natives of Fort
Wrangell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; queried some one carelessly,
and the answer came: &ldquo;The missionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mr. Selborne who spoke last. He explained
that he had just been talking with the
man, who was doing noble work in this squalid,
miserable community. His pay was a mere
pittance, and the society supporting him were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sore need of funds for the establishment of a
school or home for native children.</p>

<p>Rossiter paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them a helping hand,&rdquo; said Mr.
Percival, passing over a bill. Another and
another fell into the hat that was sent around,
and a few days afterward that missionary&rsquo;s eyes
filled with glad tears as he opened a package containing
one hundred and thirty dollars for the
needed Home, from the passengers of the <i>Queen</i>.</p>

<p>Another wonderfully beautiful evening followed
the Wrangell experience. At half-past nine fine
print could be read by daylight, and at eleven it
was by no means dark.</p>

<p>The next day the steamer touched at Douglas
Island, giving its passengers time for a run up to
the richest gold mine in the world. In the early
afternoon the <i>Queen</i> steamed across the strait
to Juneau, only a few miles distant, and stopped
there for the night.</p>

<p>It was a larger town than any they had yet seen
in Alaska, and curved around a fine bay at the
base of high mountains, on whose high slopes
could be seen patches of snow and &ldquo;young
glaciers,&rdquo; as Fred called them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Selborne and his sister at once hunted up
the Mission House, and had a long talk with Mrs.
Willard, the brave and gentle lady who gave up a
happy and comfortable home life in the East to
help the Alaskan natives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One could listen to her stories all day and not
tire of them,&rdquo; said Rossiter to Mr. Percival afterward.
&ldquo;The sufferings and the superstitions of
these poor creatures are almost incredible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after returning from the Mission, he
mailed to Fort Wrangell the valuable letter of
which we have spoken.</p>

<p>The young people scattered through the village
as soon as the steamer was moored. Mr. Percival
rode off with two gentlemen who met him upon
the wharf, to look at the Silver Bow Basin gold
mines, of which he was part owner.</p>

<p>Tom and Fred strolled along arm in arm, in
front of the houses and stores that lined the
beach, now and then stopping to speak to a
native, or examine the trinkets and furs that were
everywhere exposed for sale.</p>

<p>They were handling an unusually fine brown
bear rug, when a curious-looking man, perhaps
fifty years of age, halted by their side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/illo_108.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TOM AND FRED AT JUNEAU.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>His hair and beard were long and rough, and his
garments seemed to have been made for a wearer
much shorter and stouter than himself. He was
over six feet in height, and had a kindly, almost
child-like look in his blue eyes, which, however,
were keen as a hawk&rsquo;s, looking out from under a
pair of shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good pelt, that,&rdquo; he remarked, running
his hand over the skin. &ldquo;Thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; buyin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the New England
&ldquo;Down East&rdquo; accent, which reminded Tom of
Ruel at &ldquo;the Pines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly that,&rdquo; answered Fred, taking the
man for the proprietor of the store. &ldquo;We thought
we might price some of these rugs, though. How
much do you ask for this one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless ye!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, with a good-natured
laugh; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout
selling &rsquo;em. Ask the storekeeper in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I thought&rdquo;&mdash;began Fred, blushing a
little at his mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; laughed their new friend; &ldquo;ye took me
for the owner. Wall, you war&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so fur aout o&rsquo; the
way, either. I was the owner o&rsquo; that pelt, last
fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys waited for more; seeing which the
hunter&mdash;for such he seemed to be&mdash;went on:
&ldquo;I shot that &rsquo;ar b&rsquo;ar up &rsquo;n the Yukon valley, last
September. He was jest lookin&rsquo; fer a place to
den up, I reckon, when he run foul o&rsquo; my rifle,&rdquo;
he added, with a silent chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a bear is it?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;A
cinnamon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reg&rsquo;lar cinnamon. Braown b&rsquo;ar, some folks
call &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re&rsquo;s thick&rsquo;s squirrels back in the
maountings. But this was an extra fine one, an&rsquo;
no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the storekeeper came out and greeted
the party. &ldquo;How do you do, gentlemen? Won&rsquo;t
you walk in? Finest skins in Juneau&mdash;no harm
looking at &rsquo;em, whether you want to buy or not.
Halloo, Solomon! round again? How soon do
you start North?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, in &rsquo;baout a month, I reckon. The musquiters
are too thick to make it more&rsquo;n half-comf&rsquo;table
in the woods jest naow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Solomon Baranov, the best shot in
these parts,&rdquo; explained the storekeeper, leading
the way into his shop. &ldquo;He shoots and traps all
the time except in the hottest months of the year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
He could tell you some good bear stories, I
reckon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Baranov&rsquo;? He&rsquo;s not a Russian, is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father was Russian, and mother a Yankee.
She came from somewhere East, I&rsquo;m told. Now,
what can I show you in the way of furs or Indian
curios, gentlemen? Look at that for a fox robe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys purchased a good gray wolf skin,
handsomely mounted, knowing that Juneau was
the best place in Alaska for buying fine furs.
But they hurried out again as soon as this piece
of business was transacted, anxious to renew their
acquaintance with Baranov.</p>

<p>He was sitting on a raised platform at a little
distance, smoking an old brierwood pipe, and talking
seriously to a couple of black cubs, who gamboled
clumsily about him, tugging at their chains
and pushing their snouts into his capacious jacket
pockets for eatables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he was saying gravely as the
boys came up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think o&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else besides
eatin&rsquo; all day. Haven&rsquo;t ye got any ambition?
Don&rsquo;t it wear on ye bein&rsquo; tied up, instead o&rsquo; rootin&rsquo;
raound in the woods I took ye from last March?
Halloo, boys! Find a pelt ye liked?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom opened his package and displayed the wolf
skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, very good,&rdquo; said the old hunter,
running his hand through the fur. &ldquo;An auk
brought that in last winter. He got clawed up
putty well, too, killin&rsquo; the critter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell us something about the hunting
around here,&rdquo; said Tom, as he and Fred flung
themselves down beside the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell ye somethin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;d show ye somethin&rsquo; ef
we only hed time. Why, thar&rsquo;s b&rsquo;ars within three
gunshot o&rsquo; this very spot, like&rsquo;s not, back a piece
on the maounting. How long d&rsquo;ye stay here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stoppin&rsquo; on the <i>Queen</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; with a big Excursion from Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, then, your Excursion won&rsquo;t get away
from Juneau before day after to-morrow evenin&rsquo;,
at the arliest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried
both boys at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s given aout in the steamer&rsquo;s
machinery. I heard Cap&rsquo;n Carroll say an hour
ago that he must stop here to fix it, and &rsquo;twould
take two days at least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we could go with you. Will you take
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ef your folks is willin&rsquo;, and you ain&rsquo;t
afraid of a long tramp, an&rsquo; wet feet, and mebbe
a b&rsquo;ar or two&mdash;an&rsquo; musquiters,&rdquo; he added in a
comical tone, &ldquo;we could fix it so&rsquo;s to git away
arly to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, camp one night, and be
back before noon Thursday, ef nothin&rsquo; happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t any guns&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! two rifles is all we&rsquo;d want in this craowd.
Thar&rsquo;s my piece at home, and I&rsquo;d borrow one
somewhars in Juneau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you what, Fred,&rdquo; shouted Tom,
&ldquo;if father&rsquo;s willing we should go, we can have a
big time, and perhaps kill a bear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; said Fred, catching fire from the
other&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be seeing a bit of
Alaska that isn&rsquo;t down on the programme, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your father raound?&rdquo; asked Solomon, with
a meditative puff at his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone off to look at some mines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;&lsquo;Silver Bow,&rsquo; I s&rsquo;pose. When d&rsquo;ye
expect him back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before supper, he said. Where can we find
you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You c&rsquo;n call me Solomon or Baranov, jest&rsquo;s
ye please,&rdquo; said the hunter. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no
&lsquo;mister&rsquo; to it. I&rsquo;ll meet you here, or what&rsquo;s
better, I&rsquo;ll be daown on the wharf at eight o&rsquo;clock
to-night. What&rsquo;s your names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Percival and Fred Seacomb. I&rsquo;ll bring
my father with me.&rdquo; And with mutual good-bys
they parted for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Tom could think of nothing but the coming
tramp, and dignified Fred displayed a degree of
excitement which was, to say the least, unusual.
The girls looked anxious when they heard the
plan, but admitted that if they were boys it would
be great fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked Tom, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be awfully
lonesome without us, that day and a half. But
you must bear up under it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Kittie demurely. &ldquo;But if you
go, we shall expect a good bear skin apiece, to pay
for the lonesomeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em put their paws on your shoulders,
Tom,&rdquo; counseled Randolph solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor try to pacify them with sugar,&rdquo; added
Pet, to whom Randolph had basely confided the
story of his cousin&rsquo;s adventure at Glacier Station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the laughter, Mr. Percival
arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, we want to go off on a bear-hunt,&rdquo; began
Tom, all in a breath. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re willing,
aren&rsquo;t you, sir? And Solomon says&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Percival, taking a
seat on a stool&mdash;for this conversation took place
on the deck of the <i>Queen</i>, just in front of the
open stateroom doors&mdash;&ldquo;who is it that wants to
go on a bear-hunt? Bess, I suppose, and Miss
Selborne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all shouted at this, Adelaide as merrily
as the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t want to hunt bears, Mr. Percival,&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Nothing short of elephants will do
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all began talking at once, and at last
Mr. Percival obtained some clear idea of the plan.
He looked grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Captain Carroll first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
then I&rsquo;ll talk with your friend, Baranov.&rdquo; And
that was all the satisfaction he would give the
eager young hunters.</p>

<p>The captain, who seemed to know all the old
miners, traders and hunters on the coast, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
have given Mr. Percival a good report of Solomon,
for the father&rsquo;s face cleared as he talked with the
bluff commander of the <i>Queen</i>.</p>

<p>Supper over, all the interested parties descended
to the wharf, where, in due time, the old hunter
made his appearance.</p>

<p>Tom performed the necessary introductions,
and for ten minutes there was an earnest conversation
between the two men, as to the proposed
trip. The boys watched every turn and gesture,
as they talked. Randolph had been asked to join
the party, but he was greatly interested in the
new works at the mine, and preferred to spend
the day in visiting the Basin and going through
the great half-mile tunnel in which the gold was to
be drawn off by the &ldquo;placer&rdquo; process.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Percival, wheeling around
suddenly on his heel, &ldquo;I have decided to let
you go. Baranov says he will take good care of
you; and Captain Carroll tells me he always
keeps his word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solomon inclined his head gravely, but smoked
in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will start at three o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; added Mr. Percival. &ldquo;Solomon will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
bring all the necessary outfit for the trip, including
an extra rifle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Baranov, moving off in a
leisurely manner, as if he had engaged to step
across the street, rather than take charge of two
inexperienced city boys on a twenty-mile tramp
over the mountain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br /><br />

<small>ALIVE OR DEAD?</small></h2>


<p>It seemed to Tom that he had hardly been
asleep five minutes, when he felt a hand on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, my boy! Baranov is on the wharf,
waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With only half his wits about him, and a vague
remembrance of his experience the previous year,
Tom sprang up hastily, crying out, &ldquo;Is there
a fire?&rdquo; Then he saw his father&rsquo;s expression,
amused, but a little anxious, and remembered the
plan for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up for, father?&rdquo; he asked, as
he scrambled into his thick traveling suit. &ldquo;You
ought to be sound asleep in your berth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival smiled, in reply. &ldquo;I wanted to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
you start,&rdquo; he said simply. Ah, these patient, loving,
anxious fathers and mothers who get up early to
see their children start, and sit up late to welcome
them home! How little we think of it when we
are boys&mdash;how the recollection of it all, and of
our own heedlessness comes to us, in after years!</p>

<p>Fred was already up, as he shared Tom&rsquo;s stateroom
on the steamer. In a few minutes more
they were out in the sweet morning air, and, stepping
softly and speaking in low tones, not to
disturb the sleepers, they passed through the gangway
and down to the wharf, accompanied by Mr.
Percival.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising, and the whole sky was
golden with its coming, over the dark eastern
hills. It would be an hour or more before his first
rays would rest on the house-tops of Juneau.</p>

<p>There was the old hunter, leaning against one
of the mooring-posts, and looking off over the
quiet Sound, to the dim blue mountains beyond.
At his feet lay a large pack, two tin dippers and
an ax. In the hollow of his left arm he held two
guns.</p>

<p>As the travelers left the steamer, he turned toward
them with an alert air that belied his pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>vious
slouching attitude and straggling, iron-gray
hair. The first greetings over, he proceeded at once
to divide the luggage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the pack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and my ax.
You two boys take the guns&mdash;we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t need
to load &rsquo;em much before noon. Tie a tin dipper
around your waist, each of ye. Here&rsquo;s
some twine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got provisions?&rdquo; asked Mr. Percival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; replied Solomon. &ldquo;All ready, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by! good-by!&rdquo; they said, still speaking
quietly. While Fred, seeing a crimson handkerchief&mdash;which
looked remarkably like one worn
by Kittie the day before&mdash;waving from one of
the little stateroom windows, waved his in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Fred. My dear boy,&rdquo; turning to
Tom, &ldquo;take care of yourself. Remember, if you
are delayed, I shall not leave Juneau without
you. Allow plenty of time for the return trip.
Be very careful of the guns. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anxious father pressed both the boys&rsquo; hands.
They turned away, and passing around the buildings
at the head of the wharf, were soon out of
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more he saw them, as they climbed the
first low hill, back of the town. They waved their
hats to him, then disappeared in the edge of the
forest.</p>

<p>All the party were rather grave at the breakfast
table, that morning. Mrs. Percival had been
greatly disinclined to consent to the hunt, but she
was a strong woman, and was afraid of trusting
her feelings in a matter where she admitted her
husband was the best judge.</p>

<p>In the forenoon Randolph accompanied his
uncle to the Silver Bow Basin, and inspected for
himself the marvelous valley whose sands are so
filled with precious metal that miners for years
have worked in it here and there, successfully
washing out gold with the rudest contrivances.</p>

<p>The superintendent in charge of the principal
works showed them the tunnel, and the process of
sluicing out the sand by a powerful stream of
water, or &ldquo;hydraulicking,&rdquo; as he called it. The
stream plunged into the sand in a deep pit, and
then rushed off rapidly through a long tunnel
which had been dug and blasted through the rocky
heart of the mountain toward the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What takes the gold out?&rdquo; asked Randolph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we place those cross pieces, or riffles, at
short distances all the way down, in the sluice-way
which runs the whole length of the tunnel. On
the upper side of the riffles is placed a quantity of
quicksilver for which the gold has such an affinity
(it sinks to the bottom of the stream), that it combines
with it. Every week or so we have a &lsquo;clean
up,&rsquo; when a good many thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of
gold is taken out and shipped South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you begin to work?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Percival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we calculate to commence operations
about the first of May. It&rsquo;s according to the
season. Of course we can&rsquo;t get our power until
the snow melts on the mountains, and we get a
good head of water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a thorough examination of these mines,
they returned to the village, and in the afternoon
took the ferry boat to Douglas Island, where they
once more inspected the great treadwell mine
which sometimes turns out a hundred thousand
dollars&rsquo; worth of gold in a single month.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illo_124.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ALASKAN BASKET WEAVERS AT HOME.</div>
</div>

<p>The ore here is imbedded in quartz, which is
crushed in an immense stamp-mill where the noise
of the crushers was so great that the loudest shout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>could not be heard. Randolph and Mr. Percival
could only communicate with the guide and with
each other by signs, as they walked through the
building.</p>

<p>While these two were off on their mining tour,
Bessie managed, with the help of a cane and Mr.
Selborne&rsquo;s arm, to walk slowly along the main
street of Juneau. There were a number of fur
stores, and others with beautiful displays of Chilkat
blankets and baskets, the latter in many odd
varieties of shape and color.</p>

<p>Native women sat in groups, with their wares
spread out on the sidewalk before them; baskets,
carvings, silver bracelets, and a queer kind of
orange-colored fruit which the visitors found were
the famous &ldquo;salmon berries&rdquo; of Alaska.</p>

<p>Rossiter bought a silver spoon, finely carved,
with some sort of a bird&rsquo;s-head design.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a bird is it?&rdquo; asked the minister.</p>

<p>The Alaskan shook his head, to show he did not
understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo; asked Rossiter again, very
slowly, and a little more loudly, as one is apt to
speak, in trying to converse with a foreigner.</p>

<p>The native seemed now to gather the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of the question, but was at a loss to express himself
in reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly with a quick smile he flapped his arms
like wings, and cried &ldquo;Caw! caw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Selborne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a raven!&rdquo;
and the vendor nodded his head violently, much
gratified at the success of his pantomime.</p>

<p>Next morning the sole topic was, How soon will
they return? Have they found any game? Won&rsquo;t
they be tired!</p>

<p>Captain Carroll pinned up a notice in the main
saloon, stating that the steamer would sail at three
in the afternoon, the repairs having been completed
more quickly than he had expected.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival looked troubled at the change of
plan, but there was no help for it. Every hour
of delay was an additional expense to the company;
and besides, certain perilous straits ahead
had to be passed at exactly such a tide, and the
captain had made his calculations accordingly.</p>

<p>Noon came, but with it no sign of the hunters.</p>

<p>One o&rsquo;clock. All the Percival party, and indeed
most of the steamer&rsquo;s passengers who knew
the situation and were acquainted with the boys,
gathered on deck, gazing anxiously toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
high slopes which rimmed the town. Still no
indication of the returning party.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival now packed his own valise, as well
as those of his son and Fred, and told his family
he should remain in Juneau if the boys did not
return in time for the boat. The <i>Queen</i> was to
touch here, contrary to its usual custom, to take a
shipment of bullion on its way back to the States.
The party could manage quite well on board ship
during the intervening four or five days; and
although Mrs. Percival&rsquo;s heart was torn with
anxiety, she could see no better plan.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock, therefore, Mr. Percival stood
on the wharf with the three portmanteaus, and the
<i>Queen</i>, giving a long blast of its whistle, moved
majestically northward.</p>

<p>The head of the family who had thus remained
behind soon found comfortable lodgings for himself
near by, and then repaired directly to the
wharf, where he was sure the belated hunters
would hasten at once, on their return.</p>

<p>Supper-time came, and a poor meal he made of
it, at his lodging-house. Returning to the wharf
he vainly paced the planks in the golden twilight
until nearly midnight, when he slowly retraced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
steps to his lodgings, full of forebodings and self-reproach
for his weakness in consenting to indulge
his heedless boy in such a reckless undertaking.</p>

<p>In the morning he was astir at sunrise, but his
repeated and anxious inquiries failed to reveal any
news of the absent ones.</p>

<p>Looking haggard and old, he set about raising a
relief party, to start up the mountain at once.
Alive or dead, they must be found!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE SILVER-TIP.</small></h2>


<p>On leaving the wharf, Baranov had led the
way directly up through the settlement,
past the Mission School, until he reached the very
outskirts of the village, where, in a half-cleared
patch of ground, the boys stopped to get breath
and wave a last good-by to their father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naow,&rdquo; said the guide, with some emphasis,
&ldquo;comes the tug of war. You&rsquo;ve both got good
thick boots on, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was well-equipped in this respect, and
Fred&rsquo;s shoes were heavy enough for ordinarily
rough walking and weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a blanket apiece <i>cached</i> here,&rdquo; continued
Baranov, looking about him, and presently
drawing out two bundles from beneath a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
stump, where he must have hidden them the night
before. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be pretty heavy for ye to lug,
but thar&rsquo;s no tent, and it&rsquo;ll be cold enough before
mornin&rsquo; to make you glad you brought &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thereupon produced some twine and straps,
and arranged a blanket on the back of each of the
two boys, so as to make the loads as easy as
possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my blanket and a rubber to put under
us,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;in my bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, this isn&rsquo;t any load!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
light&rsquo;s a feather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solomon smiled grimly as he swung his fifty-pound
pack over his shoulder, picked up his ax,
and started into the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll grow a leetle heavier before night,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way them blankets have, in this
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; asked Fred,
adjusting his eyeglasses for the tenth time, as he
stumbled over a mossy log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, I think we&rsquo;ll strike into the old trail that
leads up to the Silver Bow, and foller that fer a
piece. Then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rough tract of land lay between the clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and the path. Baranov went right ahead, striding
along over fallen trees and bowlders, with smoke-wreaths
from his pipe floating back over his broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>The forest was carpeted with deep, wet moss,
into which the boys often sank to their knees;
and more than once they tripped and nearly fell.
The mountain-side was thickly wooded with
spruce, yellow cedar and hemlock, the tough
branches of which, wet with dew, twisted around
their legs and swished into their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;Thomas,&rdquo; sung out Fred, after ten
minutes of this sort of work, &ldquo;is that blanket&mdash;any
lighter&mdash;than &rsquo;twas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much! It&rsquo;s gained&mdash;five pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do think&mdash;of the&mdash;scenery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The emphasis on the last word was caused by
his setting foot on the slippery surface of a rock
concealed by moss, and sitting down with great
firmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty good fall landscape,&rdquo; gasped
Tom, leaning against a stump, weak from laughter.</p>

<p>But lo! the stump, like many others of its kind
thereabouts, was decayed, and over it went, carrying
Tom with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>When the boys had struggled to their feet, they
found that Baranov had stopped just ahead of
them, and was chuckling over their mishaps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, old fellow,&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;is it going
to be this way all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Baranov. &ldquo;Mebbe I oughtn&rsquo;t
to hev laughed at ye. But I saw no harm was
done. Ye&rsquo;ve got good pluck, both of ye, not to
ask me to slow up before naow. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I put on
a leetle extra steam, to see what ye was made of&mdash;with
that ar light blanket&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the wust on it&rsquo;s over, for quite a spell.
Thar&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar Basin trail jest ahead. We can
follow that for a mile or two, before strikin&rsquo; off
up the side of the maounting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a relief to walk in a traveled path once
more, although it was a very rough one.</p>

<p>It was just five o&rsquo;clock when Solomon called a
halt, and announced that they were something
over three miles from the wharf at Juneau, having
been a little more than an hour and a half in
reaching this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a glorious spot!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
throwing himself down beside the path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The ground was clear for a little way in front
of them, and just beyond lay the Silver Bow
Basin, narrowing and winding far up among the
mountains. On every side the forest-clad slopes
rose in grand sweeps from the Basin, and curls of
smoke here and there floated up from camps
hidden among the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo; asked Fred, as a metallic
clicking not far away fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! thar&rsquo;s always somebody prospectin&rsquo; raound
with his pick,&rdquo; remarked the hunter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
hear &rsquo;em all over the maountings, pretty much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Close beside them a stream of crystal clear
water rushed over its stony bed, across the path
toward the valley. The boys unfastened their
dippers and drank deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some salmon berries?&rdquo; asked Solomon.
And he threw down a branch of the orange-colored
fruit he had just broken off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naow,&rdquo; he said, after a few moments&rsquo; silence,
&ldquo;we must take to the woods. I gave ye that
leetle piece of rough travelin&rsquo; to kinder harden ye
fer what was comin&rsquo;. Are ye ready, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; they cried, springing to their
feet. &ldquo;Lead the way, Solomon!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hunter now left the beaten path and followed
up the bed of the stream, which crossed it
at right angles. It was hard climbing, and the
boys had to stop for frequent rests. Their tramp
proceeded, however, without special incident for a
couple of hours more, when Baranov threw down
his pack and called out &ldquo;Breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ought to have mentioned that a cold lunch
had been prepared the night before, and the three
trampers had partaken sparingly of it before starting.
Now, however, they had a sharpened appetite,
and ate ravenously of the doughnuts, hard
bread and sandwiches which Solomon brought out
of his stores.</p>

<p>This halt occupied about an hour, so that it was
nearly nine when they resumed their walk.</p>

<p>Their progress now became very slow. The
picks of the miners were no longer heard, and
they realized that they were in the veritable
Alaskan wilderness. The rush of the little brook
was the only sound that broke the silence of the
moss-draped and carpeted forest.</p>

<p>They had passed beyond the brow of the mountain
immediately overlooking Juneau, and, while
the grade was not quite so steep, the evergreens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
grew more densely, and the stream was so narrow
as to barely afford them a pathway. Of course
their feet had been soaked during the very first
hour of their climb. There was now not a dry
stitch on either of the boys, below the waist.</p>

<p>For a few rods, Solomon had been peering here
and there; Tom afterward declared he fairly
sniffed the air for game, like a hound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Solomon?&rdquo; called out Tom, picking
himself out of a crevice between two wet
rocks.</p>

<p>The hunter held up his hand for silence; then
stooped and carefully examined a log just in front
of him. Calling the boys, he pointed to it with
one of his silent chuckles.</p>

<p>Fred adjusted his glasses and eyed the log
critically. &ldquo;It seems just a common, every-day
log, don&rsquo;t it, Tom?&rdquo; he remarked in a guarded
voice to that young man.</p>

<p>It was a fallen hemlock, lying directly across
their path. Baranov laid his finger lightly on a
small reddish spot, where the bark had been
scraped off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A b&rsquo;ar did that,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;An not
long ago, neither.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys instinctively clutched their empty
guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my rifle,&rdquo; the hunter said, in the
same tone. &ldquo;I must load her an&rsquo; hev her ready
in case we come on the critter sudd&rsquo;nly. But I&rsquo;ll
let you do your own shootin&rsquo; ef I can. Fred,
you must take the ax naow, an&rsquo; be awful keerful
of it. Carry it blade aout from ye, an&rsquo; not
over your shoulder. Naow foller me as easy&rsquo;s
you kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crept along, Indian file, for half an hour
or more.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s foot sank into something that crunched
under the moss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snow!&rdquo; he exclaimed; and indeed they all
were standing on the edge of a huge snow bank.</p>

<p>Something about this appeared to please
Solomon very much, though the boys could not
tell why. But now he was stopping and pointing
again. Ah! that was why the old hunter was
gratified by finding that the trail crossed a snow
bank. Master Bruin could pass through the thick
scrub of the forest so deftly that even the keen
eye of the best guide in Juneau could hardly distinguish
the course of his journey. Not so when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
he crossed the snow. There was his track, plain
enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! don&rsquo;t it look like a boy&rsquo;s barefoot mark?&rdquo;
exclaimed Tom, quivering with excitement. &ldquo;Is
he near here, do you think, Solomon? What sort
of a bear is it? Is he a big one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baranov answered at once, as he shouldered his
pack and rifle again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trail&rsquo;s abaout an hour old. He&rsquo;s a purty
good-sized black b&rsquo;ar, I should say. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s my
opinion we can fetch him afore night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On they went, faster than before. Indeed, the
boys soon noticed that they were now following a
sort of beaten track&mdash;no other, Solomon assured
them, than one of the famous &ldquo;bear-paths,&rdquo; thousands
of which thread the deepest and loneliest
jungles of Alaska.</p>

<p>They halted for a hasty dinner and then pressed
forward. Baranov could not be positive that the
same bear was before them on this hard track, but
it seemed highly improbable that <i>Ursus Americanus</i>
had left his easy highway for the almost
impenetrable growth of evergreens on either side.</p>

<p>It was about three in the afternoon when Baranov
halted so suddenly that Fred, who was next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
behind him, fairly tumbled against him, nearly upsetting
the hunter. The latter, however, paid no
attention to this. He was too much occupied in
examining half a dozen hairs, which he had picked
from a low spruce bough projecting across the
path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the boys whispered eagerly,
their fatigue gone in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at them ha&rsquo;rs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re almost white! They are white
at the tips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The animil that went through here ahead of
us, left &rsquo;em behind,&rdquo; said the guide. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no black b&rsquo;ar, neither, as you can see for
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it&mdash;not grizzly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea was not wholly a pleasant one, and
the young hunters looked nervously around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s no grizzly. It&rsquo;s my opinion that
a big silver-tip, a glacier b&rsquo;ar, some calls &rsquo;em, is
just beyond,&rdquo; rejoined Baranov.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glacier bear? I never heard of one before,&rdquo;
whispered Fred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ugly fellers, an&rsquo; mighty scarce raound
these parts. The trappers north of here call &rsquo;em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Mount St. Elias b&rsquo;ars, because there&rsquo;s more of &rsquo;em
there. The pelt&rsquo;s wuth double a black b&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s.
It&rsquo;ll be great luck ef we find one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This whole conversation was carried on in an
undertone, and without further noise or delay, the
party pushed on.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour&rsquo;s forced march they
found themselves on a sort of level tableland, at a
great elevation above the sea. Here and there
were patches of snow, and small glaciers could be
distinctly seen on distant mountain slopes, toward
the east and north.</p>

<p>The scene near at hand was utterly desolate and
forbidding. The bear path, too, had &ldquo;ended in a
squirrel track and run up a tree,&rdquo; Tom declared.
He was on the point of proposing a halt for a rest,
if not for the night, when he caught sight of a
grayish patch in a clump of low spruces about
a hundred yards distant. He was sure it had
moved while he was looking. His heart beat
violently as he gave a low whistle to attract
Baranov&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>The guide&rsquo;s eye no sooner rested on the object
than he sank as if he had been shot. The boys
did the same, and cautiously crawled to his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Slip a cartridge into that rifle quick,&rdquo; he whispered
to Fred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Silver Tip, sure, an&rsquo;
ef we work it jest right, we can drop him. Naow
don&rsquo;t you move for five minutes. Before long,
you&rsquo;ll see him start this way. When he gets up
to that rock over thar between them two leetle
spruces, Tom, you let drive. Don&rsquo;t you fire, Fred,
till Tom gets another cartridge in. An&rsquo; ef you
miss him, run fer your lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the boys could ask where he was going
or what his plans were, the old hunter had disappeared
in the undergrowth, taking his ax with him.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing freshly from Bruin toward
them. In the course of a few minutes, which
seemed hours, they saw the animal push his snout
out from the boughs and sniff the air curiously.
There was a strange scent, he thought, lingering
about this mountain-top. What could it be?</p>

<p>Whatever its nature, it evidently acted like the
reverse end of the magnet to the shaggy beast;
for after a moment&rsquo;s uneasy moving about, he
started off in a line which would carry him very
near the ambushed hunters.</p>

<p>On he came, crashing through the boughs and
clambering nimbly over mossy bowlders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Fred could feel that his companion was trembling
from head to foot from excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest over that twig, Tom,&rdquo; he whispered in
his ear. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get a shot if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two spruces were reached. Bang! slam!
went two rifles; for forgetting Solomon&rsquo;s injunction,
Fred pulled the trigger almost at the same
instant with Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted a welcome voice in the
direction from which the bear had come. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
done it, boys! Wait till I come before you go
near him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With arms and legs flying like a windmill, and
ax ready, Solomon came floundering along the
bear&rsquo;s track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dropped him, fust shot!&rdquo; he called out again.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, sure enough&mdash;look out!&rdquo; For at
that very moment the bear struggled to his feet
and made a mad rush toward his assailants.</p>

<p>Fred had thrown down his rifle at Solomon&rsquo;s
last shout, but Tom had the presence of mind to
level his reloaded piece and fire. Then he turned
to run, but Bruin, making one last plunge, threw
out his big paw.</p>

<p>Tom felt a sensation like a shovelful of red-hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
coals dropped down his right boot-leg, and with a
howl of pain and fright, tumbled headlong.</p>

<p>Had not Solomon reached the scene at that very
moment with his ax, this story might have had a
sad ending. One mighty sweep of that terrible
weapon, and the battle was finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye hurt, boy?&rdquo; cried the hunter. &ldquo;Your
last shot did the business, but I had to kinder
second the motion. Whar are ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom sat up straight, shouted: &ldquo;Here I am!
Hurrah!&rdquo; and with a very queer feeling in his
head, rolled over on the moss.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, the first thing he saw
was Solomon bending over him, chafing his hands
and trying to force some kind of hot liquor down
his throat. There was the tinkling of a tiny
stream somewhere among the moss close by, and
a big Douglas fir stretched its boughs overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where are we?&rdquo; he stammered, trying
to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naow don&rsquo;t ye go to rushin&rsquo; raound,&rdquo; counseled
Baranov. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lugged ye off a piece to a
first-rate leetle campin&rsquo; graound, an&rsquo; all you&rsquo;ve got
to do is to lay still whar ye be, while Fred an&rsquo; I
fix things a leetle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the bear&rdquo;&mdash;began Tom, trying to remember,
and wondering what made his head swim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right whar we left him, an&rsquo; thar he&rsquo;ll stay
I reckon, till we get ready to borrer his coat.
Got some kindling, Fred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; called that genteel young
man, staggering up with an armful of dry boughs.
His hands were covered with pitch and his eyeglasses
dangled from the cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo, you scarred old veteran, you!&rdquo; he
cried, dropping on his knees beside Tom. &ldquo;Feeling
better? What a clip he did give you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom, beginning to feel conscious of a score or
two of bees stinging his right leg, looked down
at that member, and was surprised to find his boot
was removed and its place supplied by bandages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be lame more&rsquo;n a few days,&rdquo; said
Baranov consolingly. &ldquo;He only jest raked you
with his claws. But the bleeding made ye faint,
most likely. You&rsquo;re all right naow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very pleasant lying there and watching
the other two in their preparations for the night.
A roaring fire was kindled, and although the sun
was still high, the warmth of the red flames was
by no means unwelcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Slash, slash! went Solomon&rsquo;s keen ax, and
tree after tree came swishing down before its
strokes. Some of them he trimmed with a dozen
clips to each, and bade Fred carry the boughs into
camp. As if by magic a framework of crotched
sticks, props and rafters grew under the sheltering
fir, boughs were piled on and across them, and
by six o&rsquo;clock there was a snug brush camp ready
for occupancy, with a bed of fragrant fir boughs
two feet deep. Then came the firewood&mdash;larger
trees, felled and cut into six-foot lengths.</p>

<p>When a good pile of these had been provided,
and not before, Solomon drove his ax into the
trunk of the fir, pulled on his coat, and sitting down
on a small log which, running across the front of
the camp formed a sort of seat and threshold to it,
opened his bag and drew out a black coffee-pot.
This being placed on the fire, he started off for
the scene of the late battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;low we&rsquo;ll have a good b&rsquo;ar steak to-night,&rdquo;
he said, as he went. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he is preparing supper for the two tired
and hungry boys, we will return to the gentler
portion of the family, and follow the <i>Queen</i> northward
on its voyage.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br /><br />

<small>ON THE MUIR GLACIER.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Away up here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Bessie who was speaking her
thoughts aloud, as she leaned upon the rail of the
good steamer <i>Queen</i>, and looked dreamily out over
the blue water toward the mountains on the mainland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Way up here, in Alaska! Really in Alaska!
I can&rsquo;t realize it!&rdquo; she went on, turning to Rossiter
Selborne, who was seated by her side. &ldquo;Just
think, that shore over there is a part of the pink
patch in the map of North America, in the very
upper left-hand corner. And I&rsquo;ve come all the
way from Boston, across the whole continent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed hard to realize that they were in
those strange, far-away waters. Near the ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
porpoises leaped merrily through the sunlit spray
of the waves. Now and then a queer-looking canoe
shot by, paddled by dark-faced natives. On shore
they could see only the pathless, boundless forest
that stretched away for a thousand miles&mdash;an unbroken
wilderness&mdash;towards the North Pole.</p>

<p>It was late on the afternoon in which they
sailed from Juneau. Whatever anxieties had been
harbored in Mr. Percival&rsquo;s own mind, he had been
at some pains to conceal them from the rest of
the party. &ldquo;The hunters had simply tramped
farther than they had expected,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
found themselves too tired, after their first night
in the woods, to reach the ship at the time agreed
upon. For his part, he was glad they were not
hurrying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Percival was by no means reassured
by these remarks, and her husband&rsquo;s indifferent
manner, she did allow herself to be somewhat
comforted; and the younger folk easily fell
in with his method of accounting for the prolonged
absence of the boys. With real pleasure, therefore,
all but one settled themselves to a thorough
enjoyment of the new scenes constantly opening
around them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illo_148.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE DAVIDSON GLACIER.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>On leaving Juneau the steamer passed around
the lower end of Douglas Island, and then headed
northward once more, toward what is called the
&ldquo;Lynn Canal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun came out, warm and bright, so that
although there was a strong southerly breeze, it
was calm and comfortable even on the hurricane
deck.</p>

<p>An old Alaskan traveler had come on board
at Juneau, taking passage to a cannery in which
he was interested, farther north. There was
also a family of Thlinket Indians, bound for the
same port.</p>

<p>The stranger pointed out various objects of interest,
as they passed, including many glaciers
which sent their white tongues of ice down to the
sea front, dividing the dark forest that clothed
both mainland and islands as far as the eye
could reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the largest glacier hereabouts&mdash;the
Davidson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the most interesting.
It&rsquo;s something like three miles wide at the
foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; exclaimed
a passenger standing near by. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
over a dozen rods wide. Are you sure you are
right about that, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that dark strip lying between this
end of the glacier and the open sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;O, yes! What is it&mdash;moss, or low
bushes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those bushes are tall trees. There is a great
terminal moraine two miles from front to rear,
pushed out by the Davidson, and a whole forest
grows upon it. Here, take this glass, and you can
see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The skeptical passenger was obliged to own
himself in the wrong, and the great, silent glacier&mdash;so
motionless, yet forever moving toward the
ocean&mdash;seemed more mysterious and terrible even
than the enormous ice-stream of the Selkirks.</p>

<p>The <i>Queen</i> now made her way past the Chilkoot
Inlet, where, said Randolph, who had followed
Tom&rsquo;s example in &ldquo;reading up&rdquo; Alaska, Schwatka
started to cross the mountains and explore the
head-waters of the Yukon.</p>

<p>Pyramid Harbor, at the head of Chilkat Inlet,
was now reached, and at this point, the farthest
northing of the route, or, to be exact, at latitude
59° 13´, the steamer stopped her wheels, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
obliging stranger and the Thlinkets went ashore
in a small boat, which tossed perilously on the
choppy waves of the Inlet.</p>

<p>Slowly the steamer swung round, and, having
picked up the boat on its return, began its southward
course. The wind now swept the decks
with stinging force, driving the tourists below or
into sheltered corners.</p>

<p>Against the western sky towered the mighty
peaks of Fairweather and Crillon, lifting their
white summits nearly sixteen thousand feet above
the sea.</p>

<p>Until late in the evening the Percivals talked,
laughed and sang, while the never-ending day still
glowed brightly, and the waves tossed their foam
caps in the golden twilight.</p>


<p class='npara'>Thump! Bump! The girls woke next morning
to find the ship trembling from stem to stern.
Had the <i>Queen</i> run ashore? No, they were going
smoothly enough now. It must have been a
dream, that that&mdash;</p>

<p>Thump!</p>

<p>That was no dream, any way, for they were wide-awake
now. Out of her berth jumped Kittie, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
drawing aside the curtain from their little stateroom
window, looked out.</p>

<p>What a sight it was! The ship was moving
cautiously, at half-speed, up a narrow bay&mdash;Glacier
Bay, they afterwards heard it called&mdash;surrounded
by bare and desolate mountains, along
whose upper slopes lay dreary banks of never-melting
snow, and whose splintered summits were
hidden in dull gray clouds. Across the bay, at its
upper end, miles away, stretched an odd-looking
line of white cliffs. They could not yet make out
what gave them that strange, marble-like look.
The surface of the water was all dotted over with
floating ice, of every size and shape imaginable.
Just in front of Kittie&rsquo;s window (which overlooked
the bridge), the Captain, in thick coat and fur cap,
was pacing to and fro. Even while she looked,
the ship&rsquo;s bow struck against a good sized iceberg.
Again the steamer shuddered, and the girls knew
now what it was that had waked them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sta-a-arboard a little!&rdquo; called Captain Carroll
sharply, as another great berg loomed up, just
ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starboard, sir,&rdquo; repeated the quartermaster
and the second officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stead-a-a-ay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Port a bit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it went on, as the <i>Queen</i> dodged now
this way, now that, under the direction of the best
pilot and captain on the dangerous Alaskan coast.</p>

<p>It did not take long, you may be sure, for the
girls to finish their toilet and rush out on deck to
see the fun. One by one the passengers joined
them, wrapped in all sorts of heavy ulsters and
coats. The air was like that of mid-winter, and
the wind blew sharply.</p>

<p>The <i>Queen</i> steamed up as near as the captain
dared, and there, about an eighth of a mile distant
from the head of the bay, she waited.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, was discovered the true nature of
that line of marble cliffs. They were of solid ice,
rising to the awful height of three hundred feet
above the fretted sea, and stretching across the
bay in a mighty wall.</p>

<p>As the passengers gathered, shivering, on the forward
deck, and gazed at this wonderful ice-river&mdash;the
great Muir Glacier of Alaska&mdash;some one gave
a sudden cry, and pointed to an ice pinnacle just
abreast the ship. With a majestic movement the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
huge mass of glittering ice, larger than a church
building, loosened itself from the cliff, and with a
crash like thunder, plunged into the sea. A few
moments later and the staunch ocean steamer
rocked like a little boat on the waves made by the
falling berg.</p>

<p>Again and again the ice came tumbling down.
Sometimes immense pieces which had broken off
from the bottom of the glacier, seven hundred feet
below the surface, rose slowly and unexpectedly
from the depths, throwing the water high in air.
These bottom fragments were not white, but as
blue as indigo. From their gleaming sides the
water poured in roaring cataracts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are those sailors up to?&rdquo; sung out
Randolph suddenly, pointing to a boat&rsquo;s crew that
was leaving the side of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to fill the refrigerator, sir,&rdquo; replied a
steward, who caught the question as he passed.</p>

<p>Randolph thought he was joking; but sure
enough, the men in the boat grappled a huge
floating cake of ice, towed it to the gangway, and
made it fast to a tackle and fall, which picked it
up and swayed it over on the deck&mdash;a fine young
berg of beautiful clear ice weighing something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
over two tons. Quickly it was stowed below, and
other pieces followed. Although it was floating
in salt water, the ice coming from the glacier was
perfectly fresh. In this way about forty tons were
taken on board and stored.</p>

<p>After breakfast all who wished to do so went
ashore in the steamer&rsquo;s boats, landing on a
gravelly beach about a mile from the foot of the
glacier. Bessie was obliged to remain on board
with her mother, the rest joining the shore-going
party.</p>

<p>Leaving the beach they walked up over slippery
rocks, gravel and protruding bits of black ice,
until, before they knew it, they were on the
glacier itself. Its surface was roughened and
stained, and every now and then they came to a
wide crack or &ldquo;crevasse&rdquo; in the ice, with sloping,
treacherous sides, its shadowy depths reaching no
one knew how far below. To fall into one would
have been almost certain death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how thick this glacier is?&rdquo; asked
some one, peering down into one of these terrible
crevasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a thousand feet,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;The front of the glacier is over three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
feet high, above the sea; that gives about seven
hundred beneath the surface.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how long it is, from the source
to the front?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upwards of forty miles, I believe. And a
mile wide at the mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They could look up into the far-away, misty
mountain valleys, and still the ice stretched
beyond the utmost bound of sight.</p>

<p>As the party retraced their steps, the gentleman
who had volunteered the information regarding
height and distance, narrated the interesting story
of the discovery of the glacier by Professor John
Muir. He told them how the intrepid Scotchman,
on reaching Cross Sound, had hired an
ancient native guide and two or three Indians to
paddle his canoe up Glacier Bay. As the mountain
slopes surrounding the glacier were known to
be bare of fuel, the voyagers filled their canoe
with dry cedar and pine boughs, that they might
have camp-fires to keep them alive in that almost
Arctic atmosphere, and to cook their food.</p>

<p>When the Percivals reached the head of the
moraine, they were so fortunate as to find the
professor himself standing there, talking with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
friends. He was spending the summer, it
seemed, in a rude hut not far below, and in
company with some hardy young college students,
pursuing new investigations in this marvelous
land of ice and granite.</p>

<p>Leaving Professor Muir, after an introduction
and a pleasant word or two from the famous
explorer, Randolph and the rest descended to the
beach, not by the long muddy path by which they
had come, but by striking downward through a
deep gulley, which brought them scrambling,
sliding and laughing to the sand below.</p>

<p>On this narrow strip of seashore, where were
lying great blocks of ice stranded by the ebb tide,
they walked a mile or more beneath frowning
ice-cliffs, to the very foot of the glacier, and
indeed under it, for there was a sort of cave
formed by the huge pinnacles of clear blue ice,
and into this dismal opening the young people
penetrated for a few yards, when a crackling
sound in the gleaming walls made them rush for
the open air again in mad haste. They were just
in time to escape an ugly fragment of ice, weighing
at least threescore pounds, which had become
detached from the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>After this experience they were glad to walk
back to the ship, which was now whistling a
recall to its absent children. On the way Kittie
stopped to trace, with the tip of her parasol, her
name on the smooth sand. She began another,
but after printing a large F, rubbed it out, and
with a little addition of color to her cheeks, joined
the rest, who were now tiptoeing across a narrow
plank to the boat.</p>

<p>Steam was up, and the <i>Queen</i> began at once to
work southward.</p>

<p>For fifteen miles she wriggled her way out of
the icebergs as cautiously as she had wriggled in.
Then the broad Pacific came in view, and as the
bell in the engine room rang, &ldquo;Ahead, full speed!&rdquo;
and the ship emerged from the narrow channels
and gloomy, landlocked inlets of the North, the
great billows softly rocked in their arms the <i>Queen</i>
and its passengers, while they sang merrily,</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We&rsquo;re homeward bound, homeward bound!&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we see next?&rdquo; was the question
on every tongue that night; and &ldquo;Sitka! Sitka!&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a comfort to get out into the open ocean
again. They had sailed so long through narrow
passages and between dark, lofty sweeps of
mountains, frowning with cliffs of bare rock, or
shadowy with silent ranks of pine and fir, that,
like the Delectable Mountains in &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo;
the hills seemed about to fall on them and
bury the good <i>Queen</i> out of sight under avalanches
and icebergs.</p>

<p>All that night the waves of the Pacific rocked
them gently, as the ship made its steady way
southward. What a volume it would make, if we
could have the dreams of this party of a hundred
souls on board the <i>Queen</i> for that one night
printed&mdash;and illustrated!</p>

<p>At six o&rsquo;clock next morning Randolph went on
deck. The steamer was motionless, anchored
about half a mile from shore. She was in a bay,
which was thickly sprinkled with pretty, wooded
islands, as far out as the eye could reach. Fourteen
miles away westward, rose the peak of
Mount Edgecumbe, its slopes reddened with
ancient streams of lava. It was of that exact
cone-shape, with its top cut squarely off or &ldquo;truncated,&rdquo;
that marks a volcanic formation; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
indeed, Edgecumbe was smoking away furiously
only a generation or two ago.</p>

<p>The shore line was rugged, like all the southern
Alaskan coast, with a narrow strip of level land
running along the margin of the sea. Following
this line the eye presently rested upon a collection
of houses&mdash;quite a town, it seemed, just ahead.
One large, square building was a hundred feet or
more above the rest. A sharply-pointed church
steeple rose from among the lower roofs of the
other buildings. Then Randolph knew it was
Sitka, the capital of Alaska.</p>

<p>He had hardly recognized the place when he
heard his name called from the water.</p>

<p>Rushing to the side of the vessel, he spied a
boat coming swiftly toward the <i>Queen</i>, rowed with
a sharp man-of-war stroke by four sailors in neat
suits of blue.</p>

<p>In the stern sheets sat&mdash;could it be?&mdash;yes,
Mr. Percival, Tom and Fred, all three waving
their caps and shouting wildly.</p>

<p>In another moment the boat was alongside, the
gangway steps were let down, and Fred sprang on
board. Mr. Percival came more slowly, assisting
Tom, who was observed to limp. The sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
passed up several pieces of baggage, the officer in
charge touched his cap, and away went the boat
toward Sitka. As she receded, Randolph could
read on the stern the single word in gilt letters,
<i>Pinta</i>.</p>

<p>What wild handshakings and congratulations
and volleys of questions followed on the deck of
the <i>Queen</i>, you can well guess.</p>

<p>But we must let Tom explain for himself his
adventures, his return to civilization, and his unexpected
appearance in Sitka harbor that morning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br /><br />

<small>FAIR SITKA.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;It was pretty dark and lonesome up there,
I can tell you,&rdquo; said Tom, having described
his long tramp and the death of the bear.
&ldquo;The wind rose at about nine o&rsquo;clock, and cut
like knives. Solomon had built the camp so as to
face away from the wind, and after supper Fred
and I were glad to curl up in our blankets on the
fir boughs. Solomon threw half a dozen of his
big logs on the fire, and then sat down on our
front doorstep to have a smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have heard some of his
stories, Randolph! Some years ago, before there
was any Canadian Pacific, or even a Northern
Pacific railroad, he guided a party across the
Chilkoot Pass and down the Yukon. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
on a hunt for a &lsquo;mountain of cinnabar,&rsquo; a &lsquo;Red
Mountain,&rsquo; which an Indian had told about, somewhere
in the interior. There were women in the
party, and how they ever got through the woods,
I don&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they struck off from the Yukon, after
having a brush with the Indians, followed a
native map, had to winter in the woods, almost
starved to death, and at last found the &lsquo;Red
Mountain&rsquo; was Mount Wrangell&mdash;a volcano, you
know, twenty thousand feet high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they find their cinnabar?&rdquo; asked Randolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a small quantity. But there was enough
outcrop of copper and gold to pay them for the
trip. They rafted down the Copper River, after
leaving Solomon to locate, and a year or two later
sold out at a big profit to some San Francisco
capitalists. So far as Solomon knows, the mines
have never been worked yet, they are so far
inland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell us about your getting home,&rdquo; broke
in Kittie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re more interested in that than
in your &lsquo;Red Mountain.&rsquo; Did you sleep any,
poor boys?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;The mosquitoes
settled down to business pretty soon after
midnight, and made things lively. Baranov had
some pieces of netting, and we put them over our
heads, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to do much good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say the Alaskan mosquitoes are so intelligent,&rdquo;
remarked Rossiter, &ldquo;that two of them
will hold the wings of a third close to his body,
and push him through the meshes of a net. That
accounts for their neighborliness in your camp.
Go on with the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My leg hurt so that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep much,&rdquo;
said Tom, taking up the narrative again. &ldquo;Whenever
I did dose for a few minutes, I would wake
up with a start and see Solomon putting on another
log. I don&rsquo;t believe he slept a wink all night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward morning Fred and I both got a good
nap of nearly an hour. When I opened my eyes,
I looked for Solomon, but he wasn&rsquo;t in sight&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then of course he must wake me,&rdquo; interrupted
Fred, &ldquo;and I had to get up and put wood on the
fire, lest that His Royal Highness should feel
cold. I had just got a good blaze going when
Baranov hove in sight, with a big bear steak in
one hand and a string of trout in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where in the world did you get those fish?&rsquo;
Tom sung out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! back here a piece, in a leetle pool I knew
about,&rsquo; says Solomon. &lsquo;I &rsquo;lowed we&rsquo;ll have a dish
o&rsquo; fried traouts fer breakfast, ef the brook hedn&rsquo;t
dried up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shout at Fred&rsquo;s imitation of Baranov&rsquo;s
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trout were delicious,&rdquo; said Tom, when he
could make himself heard; &ldquo;and the flavor of the
bear meat was all right, but &rsquo;twas tough as leather.
After breakfast Solomon skinned the bear in good
shape&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the skin now?&rdquo; put in Bess. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t see it in your bundles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at Juneau,&rdquo; said Mr. Percival. &ldquo;Solomon
said he&rsquo;d have it nicely dressed, and as soon as it
was cured and prepared for mounting, he would
ship it to our Boston address. Tom wanted it for
a rug with the head on, and Fred generously
yielded all claim to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kittie smiled such warm approval at his generosity
that the young student blushed, and gave
Tom a dig to go ahead with his account of their
adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so stiff and lame that I could just hobble
when we first started, right away after dinner.
I knew father and all of you would be worried, but
it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. We managed to get down
about three quarters of the way, before it was
time to stop for the night. Of course it was ever
so much easier going down than up, but it hurt
some, you can believe! Solomon helped me over
the bad places, and Fred took a double load.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We camped right beside the brook we had
followed up the day before, and started on again
before sunrise next morning. Just as we reached
the clearing above Juneau, we met a dozen men,
with father at their head, starting up the mountain
after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want to know,&rdquo; broke in Randolph,
&ldquo;is how you ever got to Sitka as soon as we did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, father made inquiries for a doctor, and
was told the best one in Juneau was the surgeon
of the <i>Pinta</i>. She&rsquo;s a Government steamer, you
know, stationed on this coast to look after our
sealing and fishery interests and the like. Dr.
Parks was awfully kind, and a splendid doctor, I
guess, by the way he treated my bear scratch.
He put some kind of a liniment on, then bound it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
all up in good shape, and wouldn&rsquo;t take a fee,
either&mdash;not a cent. When he heard our story,
he told father the <i>Pinta</i> was going to run over to
Sitka that very day, starting before noon. If we
liked, he believed the captain would take us on
board, and we could meet you there instead of
waiting for you at Juneau, and leaving you to
worry all that extra time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We said good-by to Baranov&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
how much father insisted on paying him&mdash;went
on board the little <i>Pinta</i>, arrived safe and sound
at Sitka, and here we are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Tom had finished his story, he was
showered with questions, and it was an hour longer
before the party, having taken breakfast, assembled
on deck to witness the approach to the
wharf. Another boat from the south, much
smaller and dirtier, headed for her moorings at
the same time.</p>

<p>The <i>Queen</i>, like a true King&rsquo;s Daughter, permitted
the other to pass her and make fast to the
wharf. In stately wise, Her Majesty then moved
quietly up beside her companion, and the Percivals
landed over the latter&rsquo;s decks.</p>

<p>I will not try to describe Sitka for you; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
first place, because other people have written and
printed a great deal about it, which you can find
for yourselves in the books on Alaska on the
third shelf of the fourth alcove of your Public
Library; and secondly, because Rossiter Selborne
gave his mother so concise an account of his impressions
of the place, that I shall put a part of
his letter into this chapter, as I did at Banff.</p>

<p>After describing the buildings about the wharf,
he told how he and one or two others walked
directly up the main street to the famous church
of Sitka; continuing as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little church, long ago built by the Russians
(from whom, you know, the United States
bought Alaska for about seven million dollars in
1867), was a quaint building, with a solemn guardian,
who demanded a small fee before he permitted
us to enter. There was an altar arranged after the
requirements and ceremonies of the Eastern Catholic
church; some fine priestly robes, and a really
beautiful painting of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
Services are still held in the church every Sunday.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/illo_170.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE GREEK CHURCH AT SITKA.</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Coming out of the church we walked along the
narrow streets, looking at the houses built of
squared logs by the Russians many years ago. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>building on the hill was of logs like the rest,
and proved to be the castle of stern old Governor
Baranov. I found pieces of bear&rsquo;s fur still sticking
to the walls, where the great hides had once
been nailed up, to keep out the bitter cold of
winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such funny times we had buying trinkets of
the Indians, squatting in a long row on the broad
sidewalk! All the English the Indian squaws
seemed to know was, &lsquo;One tollar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Two tollar!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not forget to tell you about the Mission
School. You walk to it along the curving, sandy
beach, near which the school buildings stand,
about half a mile from the wharf. Such fine, intelligent
faces the boys and girls have, compared
with the natives outside! It is beautiful to see
the human, the divine, driving the animal look
out of the dark faces, the eyes kindling with light,
the whole, God-given soul waking up before your
very eyes. The old fairy story of the fair princess,
Sleeping Beauty, brought to life by the kiss of a
prince, is pretty; but it will hardly move one,
after seeing the wonderful awakening of a poor,
Sitkan woman-child, at the touch of loving hands&mdash;at
the sound of her Father&rsquo;s voice, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
through the noble men and women who are doing
his work in these desolate Northern lands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little paper, the &lsquo;Northern Star,&rsquo; is printed
at the school, and gives all the latest items of
news concerning it. It costs fifty cents a year,
and the gentle lady who conducted us through the
buildings was so pleased when two or three of us
subscribed. Of course the paper comes irregularly
in the winter, when the sea-passages are
dangerous with fogs and icebergs; but you are
sure to get all your numbers sooner or later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have seen Mr. Percival sitting
in the Mission Parlor, holding a dot of a Thlinket
child on each knee! One of them was named
Marion, and the other had a long, funny Indian
name that I forgot the beginning of, before she&rsquo;d
got to the end of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scholars had a prayer meeting at the close
of day, and sang our dear, familiar hymns with
strange words to them. Here is one verse of &lsquo;I
am so glad that Jesus loves me,&rsquo; in the Thlinket
tongue:</p>


<p class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hä ish dickeewoo &#365;htoowoo y&#365;keh</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hä een ukkonniknooch dookoos&#259;h&#365;nne,</span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span><br />
<i>Cho.</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Uhtoowoo y&#365;keh Jesus h&#365;tseh&#365;,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jesus hutsehun, Jesus hutsehun;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Uhtoowoo y&#365;keh Jesus hutsehun;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Jesus kluh hutsehun.&rsquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if Our Father must smile tenderly
when he hears such uncouth sounds. Yet he
understands them all, and answers each shyly
murmured Sitka prayer, just as he does the &lsquo;Now
I lay me,&rsquo; lisped by New England baby lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The long, beautiful Northern day drew to a
close. We left the bustling town, and walking
past the Mission School, kept on around
the shore of the bay. Now the path wound in
and out of the forest; now it emerged upon the
beach, where the ripples softly patted the sand
and laughed and played together. Before long we
reached the banks of Indian River, and crossed it
by a rustic foot-bridge. The air was fragrant with
odors of balsam fir and all the cool, delicious scents
of the forest. We turned back toward the ship.
Although it was near the hour of ten, the western
sky was all golden with sunset. Against it rose
the delicate spire of the Russian church, and the
sturdy bulk of the castle. Out across the bay
the gulls and ravens wavered their slow way
among the islands.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br /><br />

<small>THE &ldquo;CHICHAGOFF DECADE.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;We have two whole days before us,&rdquo; said
Kittie the next morning, as she promenaded
up and down the deck with Fred, &ldquo;and
the steamer is going right over the same path we
took in coming. Can&rsquo;t we get up something new
so as to have some fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might have charades, or tableaux,&rdquo; suggested
Fred. &ldquo;But we should have to stay below,
getting ready for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve had &rsquo;em all before,&rdquo; interpolated
Tom, who was stretched out at his ease in a
steamer chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be pretty foggy, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
said Randolph, joining the group. &ldquo;They say
that will delay us, for we shall have to run half-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>speed,
or stop altogether. Do you see how thick
it begins to look ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had left Sitka in the early morning, and
had only Juneau to touch at&mdash;probably in the
night&mdash;before reaching the coaling station of
Nanaimo, on Vancouver&rsquo;s Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get up a paper?&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Percival. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Arctic explorers do,
I believe, when they are frozen in for the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; cried Pet. &ldquo;And everybody
in our party must contribute&mdash;except me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, and Kittie, seizing
her friend around the waist, gave her a little impromptu
waltz which set her hair flying and eyes
dancing more merrily than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we call it?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Alaskan Herald.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Northern Light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Illustrated Totem Pole&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;this from
the wounded warrior in the chair.</p>

<p>All these names being rejected, they decided to
leave the choice of names to the editor, to which
position Mr. Selborne was unanimously chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All contributions,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;must be
in my hands at five o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
paper will then be put to press, and will be read
aloud at precisely eight o&rsquo;clock, on deck, in front
of Stateroom 2 (Mr. Percival&rsquo;s), if the weather permits;
if not, in a corner of the lower cabin, after
the supper table has been cleared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All that day the literary circle thus suddenly
formed were hard at work at their manuscripts;
and many were the gales of laughter in which the
girls indulged, as they compared notes from time
to time. The editor, it should be said, had laid
down the rule that any contribution might be in
verse or prose, but if the latter, it should not contain
over twelve hundred words.</p>

<p>One by one in the course of the afternoon, the
manuscripts, signed by fictitious names, were
dropped into a box provided by the editor, who
was busy, meanwhile, not only with his own contribution,
but in arranging an artistic heading for
the sheet which was to form the first page of the
paper. He had also furnished all the aspiring authors
and authoresses with sermon paper of uniform
size, so that the whole collection might afterward be
bound together, if desired.</p>

<p>Evening came at last, and to the gratification of
all concerned, the fog lifted, so that there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
bright sunset, which would render out-of-doors
reading easy until after ten o&rsquo;clock. The party
accordingly met at the appointed spot on deck,
having kept their plan a profound secret among
themselves, so as not to have strangers present at
the reading.</p>

<p>Mrs. Percival sat just within the door of her
stateroom, while the rest grouped themselves outside
in various comfortable attitudes. The editor,
with a formidable-looking flat package in his hand,
took his position on the seat by the rail, where
the light was favorable for reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pass round the title
page of this unique periodical, merely premising
that its simple and musical title was suggested in
part by the name of the island, the wood-clad
shores of which we were passing when the idea of
the paper was first promulgated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The title sheet was accordingly inspected and
praised, with shouts of laughter, by the circle of
authors. Fortunately it has been preserved, and
can be given here in fac-simile, just as it came
from the hand of Rossiter and of his sister, who,
he admitted, had helped him by drawing the lifelike
designs with which it was embellished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The title chosen, as you see, was the &ldquo;Tri-Weekly
Chichagoff Decade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;Tri-Weekly&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Pet and Mr.
Percival together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Mr. Selborne, in his gravest
tones, &ldquo;it has greatly interested your editor to
see you all <i>try weakly</i> to produce&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was drowned in a
chorus of outcries and laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Mr. Percival, &ldquo;do you expect
to sail these waters again, in just ten years from
now? Else, why is it the &lsquo;Decade&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that, sir, merely indicates that it is a
<i>deck aid</i> to cheerfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Tom collapsed and fell over upon Randolph,
murmuring that it was enough to give a
<i>weakly-chick-a-cough</i> to hear such puns. But such
ill-timed levity was promptly suppressed.</p>

<p>Mr. Selborne now squared his shoulders, and
opened the reading with a short editorial, which
he called his</p>


<h4>SALUTATORY.</h4>

<p>It is seldom that an editor finds himself in the
position of one who greets his friends with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
hand and bids them farewell with the other; who
combines, as it were, his welcoming and his parting
bow; who enters the room and backs out of it
simultaneously; who, in short, is obliged to write
at one and the same moment, his Salutatory and
Valedictory.</p>

<p>Such is the novel and mildly exciting task of
the present incumbent of the editorial chair of the
&ldquo;Decade.&rdquo; We greet most heartily the host of
subscribers who are sure to flock to its standard;
and we beg to assure them of the integrity of its
aims, and the sound financial basis of this enterprise.
We pledge ourselves to endeavor, at any
cost, to maintain the high standard we have set
up, and so long as the &ldquo;Decade&rdquo; is published, to
suffer no unworthy line to disgrace its fair pages.</p>

<p>At the same time we feel obliged to give notice
that this is the last issue of the paper. Circumstances
over which we have no control compel the
proprietors to suspend its publication. The editor,
in resigning his position, wishes to express his
deep sense of the obligation under which his
readers have placed him, in the universal and
constant support they have given him and his
assistants, from the very inception of the enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>prise,
and the kindly criticism with which he has
always been favored.</p>



<p class='npara'>The editorial was received with a round of subdued
applause, which subsided the more quickly
that the little circle around the reader saw curious
eyes cast in their direction, and an evident inclination
on the part of other passengers to share in
the fun, which was, however, of too personal a
nature to admit a general public.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The opening piece,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Selborne,
&ldquo;is contributed by a noted historian, who of late
seems to have given his most serious attention to
verse. I am glad to have the opportunity of
laying before you this exquisite production, which
gives an accurate review of our travels thus far,
and, as the dullest reader must admit&rdquo; (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
look at me!&rdquo; put in Tom), &ldquo;blends instruction
with poetry with the most delightful result. The
poem is entitled&mdash;with no reference, I believe, to
the farming interests of the Territories&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;A. E.&rsquo; stand for?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Percival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Animated Excursionist,&rsquo; I presume, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alaskan Editor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Expatriated Amateur,&rdquo;
and various other suggestions were kindly offered
by the boys, but were frowned down by the older
members, who now called for the poem itself.</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;One bright summer morning in early July<br />
Our party assembled in Boston, to try<br />
Of travels abroad an entirely new version<br />
Afforded by Raymond &amp; Whitcomb&rsquo;s Excursion.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; shouted Tom, who was privileged
by his lameness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an ad. Herodotus
Keats wants a free ticket next year. Who is he,
I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas,&rdquo; remarked Fred, eying him severely
through his glasses, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t display your ignorance
of the great authors, nor interrupt with ribald
comments. Go on, please, Mr. Selborne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now, any way,&rdquo; muttered the Irrepressible.
The editor paid no further attention to
him, but resumed the reading:</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;The train was on hand in a place you all know well,<br />
The Causeway Street depot marked &ldquo;Boston &amp; Lowell&rdquo;;<br />
It started, and cheers rose above lamentation<br />
As, waving our hands, we rolled out of the station.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>The daisies were white in the fields around Boston,<br />
Like meadows in autumn with garments of frost on;<br />
And fair were the skies over Merrimac&rsquo;s stream,<br />
As onward, still onward, with rattle and scream,<br />
We flew o&rsquo;er the rails ever faster and faster,<br />
With never a thought of impending disaster.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t any disaster&mdash;unless the
historian foresaw, in his prophetic soul, a certain
bear&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! let up, Ran. That&rsquo;s poetical license.
Macaulay couldn&rsquo;t find anything else to rhyme
with &lsquo;faster.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;Arriving at Weirs, on Lake Winnepesaukee,<br />
Our iron steed stopped, and became sort of balky,<br />
Backed, snorted and started again with such speed<br />
That some of us nearly &lsquo;got left&rsquo; then, indeed!<br />
At the Pemigewasset we halted to dine,<br />
Then northward we sped to the Canada line,<br />
Where Thomas was homesick until pretty soon he<br />
Began to sing sadly of dear &lsquo;Annie Rooney.&rsquo;<br />
In Montreal all the attractions were seen;<br />
We dizzily whirled down the falls of Lachine<br />
Till we hardly knew whether &rsquo;twas Memphremagog or<br />
The turbulent rapids of far Caugnawauga.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned Tom.</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;And now came the splendid Canadian Pacific&mdash;<br />
Through scenes now sublime, now tame, now terrific,<br />
Past forests of fir, and along the wild shore<br />
And storm-beaten crags of Lake Sup-e-ri-or.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>There was such an outcry at this that the
captain, who was facing the bridge, looked back to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Captain,&rdquo; sung out Randolph. &ldquo;No
iceberg in sight&mdash;only a queer kind of ore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it isn&rsquo;t mine,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;The Winnepeg grasshoppers followed Miss Bess<br />
Entangling themselves in each silken tress,<br />
Nor struggled for freedom, for when they were caught<br />
They thought them but meshes the sunbeams had wrought.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We halted at Banff, where the Bow and the Spray<br />
Come leaping from cradles of snow far away;<br />
And joining white hands, the bridegroom and bride<br />
Glide silently down toward the sea side by side.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Again we have entered our palace on wheels,<br />
And cry out anew, &lsquo;How homelike it feels!&rsquo;<br />
The &lsquo;Nepigon&rsquo; broad and the stately &lsquo;Toronto&rsquo;<br />
We can never forget, not e&rsquo;en if we want to;<br />
Nor &lsquo;Calgary&rsquo; sturdy, and fair &lsquo;Missanabie&rsquo;;<br />
But nearest our hearts, there can no better car be<br />
Throughout the whole world, whatever befall,<br />
Than faithful old &lsquo;Kamloops,&rsquo; the dearest of all.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;At Glacier we saw the great river of ice,<br />
And a bear almost ate up a boy in a trice;<br />
While one of the girls gave her poor little ankle<br />
A twist and a wrench, whose twinges still rankle!<br />
At last we arrive at our long journey&rsquo;s end;<br />
The continent crossed, at Vancouver we send<br />
One glance of regret and a farewell combined<br />
O&rsquo;er the car we are leaving forever behind.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span><br />
&ldquo;At our next stopping place we had to try hard<br />
To pronounce the name of our hotel &lsquo;Dri-árd&rsquo;;<br />
Victoria&rsquo;s awfully English, you know,<br />
And nothing that&rsquo;s &lsquo;Yankee&rsquo; was found high or low,<br />
Except our excursionists, everywhere seen<br />
Until they embarked, northward bound, on the <i>Queen</i>.<br />
We sailed and we sailed, through channels and reaches,<br />
Past wild, rocky shores and verdure-clad beeches,<br />
Until we emerged from the tortuous tangle<br />
And moored at the dreary old wharf of Fort Wrangell,<br />
Where many a totem pole reared its proud head,<br />
Once gorgeous in trappings of sable and red.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;At Juneau we halted&mdash;ah! how can I tell<br />
Of all the adventures that shortly befell<br />
Two hunters, who started out boldly to kill<br />
Any sort of a beast that roamed on the hill.<br />
Their perils and hardships, when distant from Juneau<br />
And lost in the woods, I am sure that you do know<br />
Enough that on meeting the enemy there,<br />
<i>Venerunt, viderunt, vicerunt</i>&mdash;a bear!<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Since then our startling events have been fewer;<br />
We&rsquo;ve mounted the glacier that&rsquo;s named after Muir,<br />
And trembled to see its blue pinnacles fall<br />
In fragments before us, like Jericho&rsquo;s wall.<br />
We saw all we could in the fair town of Sitka,<br />
But could not go far for want of a fit car,<br />
And now we&rsquo;re sailing o&rsquo;er Frederick&rsquo;s Sound,<br />
On board the good <i>Queen</i> safe and well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Homeward bound!&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The applause which followed this effusion was
tremendous. It was suggested that the last half
of the journey had been rather slighted; but Mr.
Selborne explained that he had it direct from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
author that this disproportionate treatment was
caused by lack of time in which to fill out the
poem as originally sketched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next piece,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;was in the
nature of an epic. It was certainly personal in
its bearings; but so was every epic, and too much
delicacy in an editor always results in an insipid
periodical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The curiosity of his auditors having been thus
aroused, he gravely read:</p>


<h4>THE BEAR-HUNTER&rsquo;S FATE.</h4>

<p class='center'>BY AN OLD SUBSCRIBER.</p>

<p class='poem'>
Tom, Tom, the valiant one,<br />
Shot a bear and away he run;<br />
The bear was fleet,<br />
Poor Tom was beat,<br />
And Bruin stepped upon his feet.<br />

<p>&ldquo;Is that what Kittie manes by my &lsquo;fate&rsquo;?&rdquo;
shouted Tom, laughing good-naturedly with the
rest. &ldquo;Sure I knew something was brewin&rsquo; when
I saw her writing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contribution I have now to read,&rdquo; said
the editor, as soon as silence was restored, &ldquo;is
accompanied with an apology from the author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
stating that for lack of original material he has

<h4>MYSTERIOUS ALASKA.</h4>

<p class='center'>BY DARWIN FITZ-AGASSIZ THOMPSON.</p>

<p>The interior of Alaska is at present one of the
few remaining habitable spots on the surface of
the globe, which remain practically unexplored by
the white man.</p>

<p>A few years ago Central Africa held this distinction,
but Speke, Grant, Du Chaillu, Livingstone,
Stanley, and dozens of others have now penetrated
those somber jungles, the land of mystery, the
fabled abode of hideous monsters, giants and
dwarfs, and soon a transcontinental railroad will
connect Zanzibar with Stanley Pool and the mouth
of the Congo.</p>

<p>Within half a dozen years, Alaska has been
similarly assailed, and at this very moment there
are bands of intrepid men camping here and there
in that lonely interior, and calling upon the hitherto
impenetrable forests and desolate tundras to deliver
up the secrets they have held for untold ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless many wonderful discoveries await
these explorers and their successors. New plants
will be found, mountains of precious ore, a vast
wealth of timber and water-power, and, it may be,
strange creatures hitherto unknown to science.</p>

<p>It is believed by many that the mastodon, whose
skeleton rears itself high above the elephant&rsquo;s, in
our museums, is not entirely extinct, but actually
roams the tangled thickets of inner Alaska. It is
stated that Professor John Muir himself lends
countenance to this belief, asserting that he has
seen the bones of these mighty animals, with the
fresh flesh adhering to them. Certain it is that
the great, curved tusks of the mammoth (as it is
sometimes called) are found all over the southwestern
slope of Africa, and that natives report
encounters with huge living animals with similar
tusks.</p>

<p>An animal which is unnamed, save by the coast
hunters hereabouts, is the &ldquo;Mt. St. Elias bear,&rdquo;
such as was shot by members of our party last
week.</p>

<p>The head is very broad, and the fur a silvery
gray. The skin is highly prized, not only for
its rarity, but for its beauty, and Indians have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
known to refuse a hundred dollars for one. They
sometimes hang up such a skin in front of the
&ldquo;big house&rdquo; of their village, as a talisman to aid
them in future hunting, such is its magic power.</p>

<p>Within a few years the American bison, once
so familiar in all stories of Western adventure,
has become almost wholly extinct. A few individuals
are said to lurk in the meadows and high
tablelands of Alaska; but soon they must rank
with the mastodon.</p>

<p>I have had time to but touch upon the mysteries
of our great Northwestern Territories. Little by
little its marvels, its wealth, its beauties will
unfold to modern research, and the schoolboy of a
generation hence will look back with incredulous
wonder upon the maps, the charts and the scientific
works upon Alaska that alone are available
to-day.</p>


<p class='npara'>&ldquo;I know who wrote that,&rdquo; said Randolph, looking
meaningly at the editor.</p>

<p>The latter, however, took no notice of the
implication, and, turning over the next sheet in
the pile, read aloud the following poem, which
was unsigned:</p>

<h4>A CHRISTMAS CAROL.</h4>

<p class='poem'>
Only a bird on a bough of fir&mdash;<br />
Look, can you see his feathers stir,<br />
And hear his wee notes, soft and low,<br />
Echoes of songs of long ago?<br />
<br />
I am not bearing my cross, you see,<br />
For the cross itself is bearing me.<br />
When birds are frightened, or suffer loss,<br />
Alone in the darkness, they fly to a cross,<br />
And never are heard to moan, &ldquo;I must,&rdquo;<br />
But always twitter, &ldquo;I trust! I trust!&rdquo;<br />
For not a fluttering sparrow can fall<br />
But into His hand, who loveth all.<br />
<br />
Lord, hear thy children while they pray,<br />
Make us thy sparrows this Christmas Day.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bessie wrote that,&rdquo; whispered Pet, glancing at
the little Captain, who did not deny the authorship,
but smiled a little as she nestled closer to
her father&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I am reading verse,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Selborne, &ldquo;I may as well read, though a little out
of course, another short poem about sparrows.</p>


<h4>SPARROWS.</h4>

<p class='poem'>
From the orchard, sweet with blossoms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the waving meadow-grasses,</span><br />
From the heated, dusty pavement<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where a tired city passes,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span><br />
Rise the happy sparrow-voices,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chirps and trills, and songs of gladness&mdash;</span><br />
Bits of sunshine, changed to music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brightening, scattering clouds of sadness.</span><br />
<br />
At the first fair flush of dawning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the twilight&rsquo;s last faint shining,</span><br />
Sparrows sing, through storm and darkness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never doubting nor repining.</span><br />
<br />
Fluttering to and fro, wherever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faith is fainting, life is dreary,</span><br />
Bear they each his little message<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the hopeless and the weary:</span><br />
<br />
&ldquo;Sparrows trust their Heavenly Father;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Centuries ago he told us</span><br />
We should never fall unheeded;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his love He would enfold us.</span><br />
<br />
&ldquo;So we cast our care upon Him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never fearing for to-morrow;</span><br />
And we&rsquo;re sent by Him to help you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When your sky is dark with sorrow.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the assistant editor knows who wrote
that,&rdquo; said Mr. Percival, glancing toward Adelaide
with a smile. &ldquo;Mr. Selborne, it is getting rather
late. How many more articles have you in the&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three, sir; and one of them is very short,
being a four-line poem or quatrain. Shall I read
it now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This poem is printed so neatly that the writer
has evidently spent as much time upon it as the
producers of some of the longer pieces,&rdquo; the
editor remarked, holding the sheet for all to see.</p>


<h4>EXCELSIOR.</h4>

<p class='center'>BY A. M. ATEUR.</p>

<p class='poem'>
&rsquo;Tis said that in life the most exquisite rapture<br />
Lies not in possession, but striving to capture.<br />
Be sure that the proudest success is in vain<br />
That helps not a loftier conquest to gain.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Tom,&rdquo; said Fred Seacomb approvingly.
&ldquo;The sentiment does you credit, my son.
I recognize the authorship, however, by the style
of print rather than the high moral tone of the
poem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom laughed with the rest, and to cover his
retreat called for the next piece, which he knew
must be by Pet, as every one else but Mr. Percival
was accounted for; and his was pretty sure to be
a story.</p>

<p>Mr. Selborne&rsquo;s voice became very gentle as he
read the story of</p>

<h4>THE THREE WISHES.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear! I wish I were a tall palm-tree on
the borders of a desert, where caravans and missionaries
and pilgrims would rest in my shade.
Then I should really be of some use in the world.&rdquo;
That is what the Pine said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear! I wish I lived away up on a mountain-top,
where the wind always blows cold and
clear, and the snows lie deep in winter. People
would come from far countries to visit the mountain,
and I would be a guide by the way. Then I
should really be of some use in the world.&rdquo; That
is what the Palm said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear! I wish I were a palm-tree down in
the valley, where birds might build their nests
in my boughs, and artists would make beautiful
pictures of me. Then I should really be of some
use in the world.&rdquo; That is what the little stunted
Fir said, on the mountain-top.</p>

<p>Days and weeks came and went. The Pine
waited impatiently, and rustled all its branches in
the autumn winds, and let fall its brown needles,
until a thick carpet of them lay about its trunk on
the mossy ground. And out from the moss peeped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
a few rough green leaves. The Pine noticed that
they were shivering in the November wind, and
pityingly dropped a few more needles around
them.</p>

<p>When the storms of winter came, it stretched
its broad, evergreen boughs above the leaves, and
sheltered them with its shaggy trunk.</p>

<p>The long, cold months passed at last, and it was
spring. Still the Pine grieved and sighed because
it could be of no use in the world.</p>

<p>To be sure it had protected the timid, furry
leaves so well that they had lived, and now bore
in their midst a cluster of small pink blossoms.</p>

<p>Just before sunset a man with coarse, roughened
features and a bad look in his face, came and
threw himself down on the ground beneath the
Pine. His fists were clenched, for he was very
angry about something, and, although the Pine
never knew it, he was being tempted to a terrible
crime.</p>

<p>As the man lay there thinking evil thoughts,
and almost making up his mind to the wicked
deed, he caught a breath of fragrance which made
him for a moment forget his anger.</p>

<p>It reminded him of home, of his boyhood, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wee sister with blue eyes and waving golden hair,
with whom he used to wander into the pine-woods
near the old farmhouse and gather flowers.</p>

<p>He looked about him, and his eye fell upon the
pink flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayflowers!&rdquo; he murmured half-aloud. And
stretching out his hand he gathered them and held
their pure, sweet faces up to his own.</p>

<p>The fierce look left his eyes, and a strange
moisture came instead. His lips quivered. He
was thinking now of his mother. She had left
her children for a far country while they were still
tiny creatures. But he could remember her face
as she lay in the darkened room, resting so
peacefully.</p>

<p>And some one&mdash;was it the little blue-eyed
sister?&mdash;had placed a bunch of Mayflowers&mdash;</p>

<p>The man rose, and placing a small green spray
of pine with the blossoms, carried them away in
his big rough hand.</p>

<p>And the wicked deed was never done.</p>

<p>The Palm sheltered many weary travelers; but
the greatest good it did was after it died.</p>

<p>One day a stranger arrived and cut the tall tree
down. From its broad leaves a hundred fans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
made, and many were the fevered, throbbing brows
that were cooled by the Palm as its leaves, now
hundreds of leagues apart, waved to and fro above
the sufferers. So the Palm, although it never
knew it, was permitted to do the work of the
Master, refreshing and healing those who were
sick with all manner of diseases.</p>

<p>As to the Fir, it tried to keep a brave heart, but
it became more and more discouraged as not only
months but years rolled by, and it grew no bigger,
and could not see that it was of any use in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So homely am I, too!&rdquo; it whispered to itself,
glancing down at its little thick, gnarled trunk and
crooked boughs.</p>

<p>Its only comfort was in giving a shelter to such
small birds, and even insects, as were blown
about on these heights by the fierce mountain
tempests. Once it had a whole night of real joy,
when a white rabbit, caught by the storm miles
away from home, crouched under its boughs and
lay there snugly, a warm, sleepy ball of white fur,
till the sun called it home in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>O, Schwesterchen, seh &rsquo;auf! &rsquo;S ist ein Tannenbaum!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>Of course all firs understand German, and our
little friend knew the child said, &ldquo;O, little sister,
look here! It&rsquo;s a fir-tree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next word it heard filled it with delight.
It was the girl who spoke this time, hardly above
her breath, &ldquo;<i>Weihnachtsbaum!</i>&rdquo; which was only
a queer way of saying, &ldquo;Christmas-tree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were, in fact, the children of a German
peasant, who lived in a small hut far down the
mountain-side.</p>

<p>The Fir did not know it, but in reality the
peasant had been unfortunate of late, and had
grown so cross and surly that he declared he would
have no Christmas in his house that year. And
Hans and Gretchen had wandered away mournfully
on the mountain-side to talk it over.</p>

<p>The Fir was so glad they talked German! If
it had been French, now, I don&rsquo;t believe it could
have understood them at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is such a little one!&rdquo; said Hans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it has such lovely crosses at the end of
its boughs!&rdquo; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>(The Fir never knew before that it had crosses.
But there they were, sure enough.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut it down and try,&rdquo; said both together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>So Hans swung his small ax sturdily, and down
came the tree. That is, it was too short to fall.
It just tipped over on its side a little.</p>

<p>Well, to make the story short, the Fir was
carried down and decked out in such simple ways
as they could provide without spending any money.</p>

<p>When the peasant saw it for the first time on
Christmas Eve&mdash;they had kept it for a surprise&mdash;he
clapped his hands with delight, in spite of all
his surliness. And that night, for the first time
for many weeks, he brought out the old leather-covered
Bible and read a chapter before bed-time.</p>

<p>And what chapter was it?</p>

<p>Why, the story of the first Christmas Eve, when
Christ was born in Bethlehem.</p>



<p class='npara'>As there was now but one article left, all knew
that it must be Mr. Percival&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>They therefore composed themselves to listen
with much interest to the story entitled</p>


<h4>GETTING SQUARE WITH HIM.</h4>

<p class='center'>BY THE OLDEST INHABITANT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let that girl alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker was a tall, slightly-built boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
perhaps sixteen. His eyes flashed, and his fists
clenched nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let that girl alone, I say, or&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, or what?&rdquo; sneered a coarse-looking fellow,
some two or three years older than the first.
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think you own this town, Winthrop
Ayre, if you did come from Boston!&rdquo; And he
once more advanced toward a neatly-dressed girl,
who was timidly cowering in a corner by a stone
wall and a high fence, to avoid the touch of her
rough tormentor. The latter was supported by
two more of his kind, and all three were evidently
trying to frighten her by their fierce looks and
rude words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mort
Lapham!&rdquo; exclaimed Winthrop indignantly, placing
himself directly in front of the frightened girl.
&ldquo;Deacon Lapham&rsquo;s son might be in better business
than insulting girls in the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you want to put your finger in the pie, do
you? Here, fellows, let&rsquo;s give him a lesson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winthrop noticed that the attention of all three
was now upon him alone, and motioned to the girl
to run. She moved slowly a few steps down the
street, and then stopped. Meanwhile the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
bully raised his hand and tried to slap the city
boy in the face. Winthrop warded off the blow
easily, and retreated into the corner where the girl
had been. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep away, Mort,&rdquo; he
said quietly, though his cheeks were hot; &ldquo;and
you, too, Dick and Phil. I don&rsquo;t want to fight,
and now you&rsquo;ve let the girl go, there&rsquo;s nothing to
fight about, that I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; cried Mort, enraged at missing his
blow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you had your Sunday-school
teacher here to take care of you! She
wouldn&rsquo;t let any one hurt you, would she, Sonny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color in Winthrop&rsquo;s face deepened, but he
said nothing. He was rapidly turning over the
question in his mind, whether Miss Kingsbury
would want him to turn his cheek if three boys
struck him at once.</p>

<p>A tingling blow on that exact spot put to flight
his meditations. His fist drew back impulsively,
but he would not strike yet. He was in splendid
training, this boy, and still stood entirely on the
defense, knowing that the true hero is not he who
fights for himself, like a brute creature, but for
somebody else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; hissed Mort Lapham once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
cautiously keeping out of reach of the other&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Hit him again, Phil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the three closed about him, a determined look
in their ugly faces, the girl who had lingered irresolutely
at a few paces distance, gave a low cry
for help, and rushed up to the group as if to protect
her protector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that!&rdquo; shouted Mort, throwing out his
hand and striking her, perhaps harder than he
really meant to, full in the face.</p>

<p>Before he had time to see the effect of his blow,
there was a crash between his eyes, and the earth
seemed suddenly flying up into the sky. As he
lay on the ground half-stunned, Winthrop, who
felt that it was at last time to act, turned fiercely
on his other opponents. Surprised by the suddenness
of his attack, they forgot the superiority of
their numbers, and started backwards. Another
nervous blow from the slender young athlete, and
Phil was on his back beside his leader, while Dick
Stanwood, tripping over a stone&mdash;purposely or
not the boys never knew&mdash;went down ingloriously
with the rest. Above them stood young Ayre,
like Saint Michael over his enemies, panting and
glowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! are you hurt?&rdquo; asked the girl, hurrying
up to &ldquo;Saint Michael,&rdquo; and laying her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>Winthrop laughed. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m able to walk,&rdquo;
he said reassuringly. Then: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave these
rascals to come to their senses. May I see you
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl flushed prettily in her eagerness.
&ldquo;You are so kind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I live just the
other side of that hill, and if you&rsquo;ll come in a
few minutes and see grandpa, I&rsquo;ll be very much
obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your forehead,&rdquo; added Winthrop, as they
walked along the dusty road side by side, leaving
their three late assailants to sneak off in the opposite
direction; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that fellow hurt you,
though I don&rsquo;t believe he meant to strike you so
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it isn&rsquo;t much. I haven&rsquo;t told you who I
am,&rdquo; she added shyly. &ldquo;I know about you and
your sister Marie, over at the Elms. Your Uncle
Ayre and my grandfather are dear friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must be &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; Rowan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s rather saucy
for you to say it. My real name is Cecilia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear me! Don&rsquo;t call me that, or I shall
think you are speaking to somebody else. &lsquo;Puss&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve always been, and &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; I must be, I suppose!&rdquo;
And she gave a comical little sigh, ending
in another ripple of laughter, which was very
pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, more soberly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
how your sister was ill, and you brought her here
for her health, to stay all summer. May I come and
see her? She&rsquo;s just about my age, grandpa says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do! It will do her good, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied
Winthrop warmly, glancing at his companion&rsquo;s
pretty face and sunny curls.</p>

<p>Puss blushed a little, and suddenly became very
demure. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s grandpa&rsquo;s, where I live,&rdquo; she
said, pausing before an old, gambrel-roofed house.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the houses in Taconic were pleasant inside
and out. This one looked particularly so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you; just for a minute,&rdquo; said Winthrop,
walking up with Puss between two rows of lilac
bushes. The girl led him into a cool, old-fashioned
parlor, which had shells on the mantel-piece, and
great, irregular beams in the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Rowan, a silvery-haired gentleman, with
much stately dignity and kindly manner, soon entered,
and talked pleasantly with the boy, of his
uncle&rsquo;s younger days and Winthrop&rsquo;s own affairs.
Altogether a half-hour passed very quickly, and
Winthrop was sorry to feel obliged to take his
leave.</p>

<p>Puss went down to the gate with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure to tell your sister I am coming to-morrow,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll call again here
yourself, won&rsquo;t you? I shall not soon forget how
you took care of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winthrop drew himself up and lifted his hat in
elegant city fashion; which, however, only made
Puss laugh and shake her curls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to be the least bit dignified with
me,&rdquo; she said merrily, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t know what to
do back. We just shake hands, here in the country,
and say good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Winthrop, taking her little
brown hand with mock solemnity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; laughed Puss, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s better. Don&rsquo;t
forget your message!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Winthrop walked rapidly toward his uncle&rsquo;s
house, he went over and over the exciting events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of the afternoon. He had only arrived about a
week before, but he had already come in contact
with the three boys who had been amusing themselves
by rudely teasing Miss Cecilia Rowan, the
gentlest and prettiest girl in the village. They
were notorious, he had soon found, for their ill-behavior
and rough manners, and had even been
suspected of certain petty thefts in the neighborhood.
Winthrop could not help feeling that he
should hear from them again.</p>

<p>The meeting between his sister and Puss Rowan
took place the very next day, and the two girls
were almost immediately warm friends. As Winthrop
had predicted, Puss&rsquo;s bright face and winsome
ways won the heart of the pale city maiden
at once, and &ldquo;did her good,&rdquo; too.</p>

<p>One or two pleasant afternoons they passed together,
and several delightful trips were planned.
One of these was a small lunch party, to a favorite
spot for the village young folks, called &ldquo;Willow
Brook.&rdquo; It was about four miles from Taconic
Corner, and the road to it lay through deep woods,
adding an enjoyable drive to and fro, to the pleasures
of the day.</p>

<p>Willow Brook is a noisy little stream that comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
dancing down from a spur of the White Mountains,
finding its way through a heavy growth of
spruce and fir, over half a dozen granite ledges,
and so onward until it reaches the upper Taconic
meadows, where it suddenly becomes demure and
quiet; but, nevertheless, is all dimples when the
wind whispers to it through the sedges, or teases
for a romp under the shadow of the birch-trees
that line its bank here and there. At length
it reaches a small picturesque valley, where the
hills, though by no means lofty, perhaps remind it
of its mountain childhood; for there it pauses, and
holds in its bosom the pictures of the gently rising
uplands, with their peacefully browsing flocks
of lambs&mdash;and gathers white lilies, and so rests
a while from its journey. At times, it is true, a
dimple of the old-time fun, or an anxious shadow
as it hears the roar of machinery and busy life
beyond, hides the treasured secrets of its heart,
but as the ruffled brow smooths, you can see again
in those quiet depths, lambs, lilies, fleecy clouds,
alike snowy white and beautiful.</p>

<p>The mill had stood at the foot of &ldquo;Lily Pond,&rdquo;
where the road crossed the stream, nobody knows
how long. There was an old-fashioned dam, built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of a few logs and a good deal of earth and rock,
now overgrown with grass and bushes up to the
very sluiceway of the mill. The waste-board, over
which the water flowed in a thin, glistening sheet
in the early spring when the pond was high, was
scarcely more than ten feet long. About a hundred
feet further down the stream was a shady
grove of willows and other trees, growing down
close to the water&rsquo;s edge. Toward this spot Winthrop
with his sister, Puss and her father rode
merrily enough that hot July day. Mr. Rowan
did not go down to the grove at once, but, having
let the young people jump out with their baskets
at the Lily Pond Bridge, drove on to a neighbor&rsquo;s
to transact some business, promising to join the
party at lunch a half an hour later. Winthrop
assisted his sister carefully down over a steep embankment
to the willows, Puss springing ahead
and calling to her companions that she had found
&ldquo;a lovely place right beside the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baskets and shawls were soon safely stowed
away, and Winthrop, with the help of the girls,
arranged a sort of shelter of boughs. When a
small fire had been kindled on a flat rock just in
front, Puss laughed with delight, and Marie&rsquo;s deli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>cate
face showed a glow of healthy pleasure, which
her brother noted with quiet satisfaction. Plainly
Taconic life was bringing the frail invalid back to
strength and health.</p>

<p>Leaving the girls to chatter over the beauties of
the place and their plans for the coming weeks,
Winthrop strayed down stream a few rods, following
a cat-bird, whose whimsical calls led him to
suspect a nest among the alders which lined the
river at that point.</p>

<p>The bird kept persistently out of sight, but repeated
its cry in a more and more distressed tone,
until Winthrop reached the very heart of a thicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now!&rdquo; he said aloud, as he
stooped and thrust aside a mass of foliage. Then
he started to his feet. He had very nearly laid
his hand on&mdash;not the pretty, rounded nest of the
gray-winged thrush, but the evil, grinning features
of Mort Lapham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rayther guess we&rsquo;ve got you this time, my
Boston daisy,&rdquo; said Mort, rising in his turn. &ldquo;Tie
him up, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ugly youth&rsquo;s two boon comrades sprang forward
from the rear, and before Winthrop could
offer the slightest resistance, entangled as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in the tough, slender stems of the alders, he was
bound, hand and foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me, Phil
Bradford?&rdquo; asked the prisoner quietly, though
his heart sank as the three cowardly assailants
hurried him roughly through the underbush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough,&rdquo; growled the
other, who had not forgotten the blow given in
defense of the girl by the roadside. They emerged
presently in a little opening that crowned a bluff,
some half a dozen feet or more above the surface
of the river, where it here made a sudden bend
toward the steep bank forming at its base a deep,
black pool, with here and there a few pine needles
turning slowly in its eddies.</p>

<p>In all this time Winthrop had not uttered a cry.
He would not alarm the girls unnecessarily, and
might include them in his own dangerous situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mort, with a cruel leer, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
square up our accounts. The next time I&rsquo;m having
a little fun on my own account, I reckon you&rsquo;ll
mind your own business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words he proceeded to tie his victim
firmly to a stout young pine that grew close to the
edge of the bluff. They placed his face to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
trunk, and clasping his hands around it, lashed
them tightly together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; interposed Dick, as he saw the cords
cut into the captive&rsquo;s wrists, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t pull
&rsquo;em so tight! Don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;you&rsquo;re
hurting him awfully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winthrop set his lips together, and said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurting him!&rdquo; repeated Mort savagely. &ldquo;I
guess he&rsquo;ll wish he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt any more&rsquo;n that,
before I get through with him! Gimme that
whip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t whip him!&rdquo; cried Dick again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
scared him enough, now. You said you only
wanted to frighten him, Mort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git out o&rsquo; the way, will you? I&rsquo;m running
this job, and this slim Sunday-school chap from
the city has got to have a little more scarin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want a taste yourself, you&rsquo;ll keep
quiet, Dick Stanwood. Phil an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll duck ye in
the river, &rsquo;f you say much more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dick, who evidently regretted
his part in the matter. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all the thanks
I get, I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; And turning suddenly on his
heel, he walked away through the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Stop him, will you, Phil?&rdquo; cried
Mort angrily. But Dick had hastened his steps
and was already out of sight.</p>

<p>Still Winthrop said never a word. His face was
white, and the two guards thought he was too
frightened to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strip off his coat and vest,&rdquo; commanded Mort,
brandishing the whip. Phil obeyed his leader like
a lamb, untying the captive&rsquo;s hands cautiously,
and, with Mort&rsquo;s aid, fastening them again more
securely than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, here&rsquo;s one for interfering between
me and the girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down came the leather lash across the thinly
clad shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more for the lick you gave me between
the eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the stinging, burning blow. Still Winthrop
did not cry out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want some more, do you?&rdquo; cried Mort,
enraged at his victim&rsquo;s silence.</p>

<p>The lash was raised again. As Mort raised and
swung it, to give the full force of the blow, he
stepped backward. The embankment, long ago
undermined by the river, crumbled under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
bully&rsquo;s feet; with a shriek of terror he toppled
over, and disappeared beneath the black eddies of
the pool. Winthrop could not see what had happened,
for his back, now smarting as if living coals
were bound to it, was toward the bank. From the
sound of the falling earth, the cry of his tormentor,
and the loud splash that followed, he guessed what
had occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Untie me, quick!&rdquo; he shouted to Phil, who
stood gazing stupidly at the whirling bubbles
where his leader had disappeared. &ldquo;No, cut the
rope&mdash;take my knife out of my pocket!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil, who was always ready to follow the party
in power, obeyed mechanically. In a few seconds
Winthrop was free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he swim?&rdquo; he cried, kicking off the last
coils of the rope, as Mort rose, screaming and
splashing to the surface, and went under again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a stroke,&rdquo; said Phil stoically. &ldquo;Serves
him right, don&rsquo;t it? Say, Win, I&rsquo;m awful sorry&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he was apologizing only to the pine-tree
and the cut cords. Winthrop had sprung into the
pool, and even now had his late assailant by the
collar and was striking out for the shore lower
down, where the bank was not so high.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drown me!&rdquo; yelled Mort, rolling up his
eyes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop kicking&mdash;you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; gasped
Winthrop. &ldquo;There&mdash;put your feet down&mdash;can&rsquo;t
you touch bottom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Winthrop, my lad! Here&mdash;give me your
hand!&rdquo; cried a new voice; and Puss&rsquo;s father leaned
perilously far over the bank to assist the boy. At
the same time Phil and Dick&mdash;the latter of whom
had brought Mr. Rowan to the scene&mdash;helped
the choking, crest-fallen, dripping Mort to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; demanded the older
man sternly, surveying the cords and whip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Winthrop!&mdash;brother!&rdquo; and the two girls
came hurrying down to the river&rsquo;s edge. Winthrop
tried to toss on his coat, but did not succeed
before the stains on his poor, smarting back told
the story to his sister&rsquo;s anxious eye.</p>

<p>Of course the picnic was ended for that day.
The whole party hurried to the wagon and drove
home. On the way, Winthrop begged Mr. Rowan
not to have either of his late captors prosecuted,
or punished in any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; burst out Mort suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be, till I get square with you
somehow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls turned and looked at him in new
amazement and terror. But Winthrop understood
him better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; he replied simply, holding
out his hand to the other.</p>

<p>Mort grasped it and said no more.</p>


<p class='npara'>&ldquo;Good story, father!&rdquo; called out Tom, whose
voice, whether for approval or criticism, was never
wanting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how Mort got square
with him, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival laughed as he rose. &ldquo;That is not
of so much consequence. In such a case, &lsquo;the
readiness is all.&rsquo; Does that finish the paper, Mr.
Editor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Selborne gravely. &ldquo;And the
publication of the &lsquo;Tri-Weekly Chichagoff Decade&rsquo;
is suspended until further notice.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<small>HOMEWARD BOUND.</small></h2>


<p>The voyage southward proceeded without
special incident. &ldquo;Glaciers&rdquo; were gradually
left behind, but &ldquo;gulfs&rdquo; and bays, channels
and narrow passages were still a part of the programme.
The day following the reading of the
&ldquo;Decade&rdquo; was Sunday. Mr. Selborne at the
request of many of the passengers, preached in
the cabin, the Percivals organizing a choir which
led the singing with their clear young voices.</p>

<p>On Monday the <i>Queen</i> reached Nanaimo, a city
and coaling-station for ships, on the east shore of
Vancouver&rsquo;s Island. Tom and Fred hired a team
and drove half a dozen miles inland to a trout-brook
of which they had heard. Tom could
not walk about much, but he enjoyed the ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
immensely, and when they reached the brook he
limped along the bank to a shady spot, from
which he shouted various comments, disparaging
and otherwise, on his companion&rsquo;s methods of
angling and rather limited success. They returned
tired but happy, with a dozen silvery little
fish as trophies. In the late afternoon Randolph
and Pet headed a party to explore the city, which
they found a hot and dusty one, but, in its upper
portions, abounding in wonderfully bright flowers.</p>

<p>At one garden they stopped and bought a great
ball of nasturtiums. It was nearly twilight, and
as the travelers leaned against the fence, idly
watching the owner of the garden as he gathered
the nosegay, they saw whole flocks of evening
primroses opening their wings like yellow butterflies,
one by one.</p>

<p>This gardener, it seemed, was a blacksmith,
employed by day in a coal mine which ran out
half a mile under the sea. His business, he said,
was to keep the mules shod.</p>

<p>The shaft of this great mine came up in the
outskirts of the town, and the Percivals, earlier in
the day, had seen the huge buckets come rushing
up from the bowels of the earth, six hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
forty feet below, laden with coal and streaming
with water.</p>

<p>The evening was memorable for a row in the
harbor to an Indian burying-ground, where strange
and hideously carved figures kept watch over the
neglected graves.</p>

<p>Until a late hour, after their return from this
boating excursion, the party remained on deck,
talking over the events of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; asked Tom, &ldquo;how this place
started?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Percival, who was always
pleased to have his boy thorough in looking up
the history of a place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman named Richard Dunsmuir,
was riding horseback along a trail back on the
mountain. The horse stumbled, and when Dunsmuir
came to look at the log or stone, it was coal.
He started a big mine, with two partners who put
in about five thousand dollars apiece. A few
years later one of them sold out to Dunsmuir for
two hundred and fifty thousand, and afterward the
second one sold for seven hundred and fifty
thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Randolph. &ldquo;I say, Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
let&rsquo;s give up Latin and go into the coal-mining
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says Tom cheerfully. &ldquo;You buy a
horse and gallop through the woods till you both
tumble down. Then I&rsquo;ll pick you up, point out
the coal&mdash;if it doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be a stump&mdash;and
we&rsquo;ll go halves. Or I&rsquo;ll sell out now for ten
dollars and fifteen cents!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the steamer cast off her fasts and started
her paddles, Selborne announced that the bright
sky had, as usual, cajoled them into keeping late
hours, for it was now nearly eleven, and in four
hours it would be daylight again. Whereupon the
deck party broke up.</p>

<p>Next morning they found themselves at Victoria,
where they stopped long enough to complete
their purchases of miniature totem poles and other
Indian curiosities, which were displayed for sale
upon the wharf.</p>

<p>All through that bright day the <i>Queen</i> ploughed
her way southward through a blue, sunlit sea.
It was Puget Sound, said Tom, the cartographer
of the occasion. They touched at Port Townsend
and at Seattle. At the latter port the ship
left half her passengers, as the Excursion was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
large to be quartered at one hotel. The rest,
including the individuals in whom we are specially
interested, kept on to Tacoma. Here they said
good-by to the <i>Queen</i>&mdash;now as homelike as the
&ldquo;Kamloops&rdquo;&mdash;and took up their abode in a
large hotel which they found to be delightfully
situated on high ground, with a broad, cool veranda
overlooking the Sound.</p>

<p>Immediately after supper Tom rushed out to
have his kodak refilled. He had already taken
nearly a hundred pictures, and reveled in anticipation
of showing them, especially the instantaneous
and surreptitious views of his unconscious relatives
and friends, together with many captive bears, to
an admiring circle during the coming winter.</p>

<p>The following day was spent in riding about the
city, the planked streets and sidewalks of which
struck them as very odd, and in visiting the
Indian reservation at Puyallup, a few miles distant.
The country was very dry, and forest fires
were smouldering all along the road.</p>

<p>At Seattle, the next stopping-place, the historian
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a regular &lsquo;Pooh Bah&rsquo; on this trip,&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom) was called on for statistics concerning the
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Be accurate, my son,&rdquo; added Fred; &ldquo;but above
all, be brief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Population rising forty thousand,&rdquo; rattled off
Tom, who had his lesson well this time; &ldquo;twice
destroyed by fire, the last time in 1889. Now
nearly rebuilt again. Situated between a big body
of fresh water called Lake Washington, and Puget
Sound. Always fighting, good-naturedly enough,
with its rival Tacoma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! the dust, the dust. It lay in the streets
four inches deep. It filled the air at every step,
and powdered the pretty traveling dresses of the
girls.</p>

<p>But it was a wonderful city, with its push and
rush and fever of building and money-getting.
To-day a vacant lot, to-morrow an eight-story bank
building; to-day a peaceful bit of upland pasture,
to-morrow a huge hotel, crowded with guests from
all parts of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody can stop to walk, or even ride in
carriages,&rdquo; observed Bess. &ldquo;It fairly takes away
my breath here. You get into a cable car and
whirl off at ten miles an hour, up hill and down
dale. Do they ever sleep, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Percivals had a really enjoyable excursion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
to Lake Washington, where they sailed and
steamed to their hearts&rsquo; content. A cable car
took them to and from the lake, and beside the
road they could see lots of land offered for sale at
high foot-rates, with tall forest-trees still standing
in them; others, partly built upon, and occupied
by fine dwelling-houses, with the back yard full of
charred stumps.</p>

<p>The busiest streets of the city, like those of
Tacoma, were &ldquo;paved&rdquo; with four-inch planks.
Electric cars, as well as those run by cable, dashed
to and fro with startling speed. The air was so
filled with smoke from forest fires that ships in
the harbor could hardly be distinguished from the
shore. A day&rsquo;s ride through a wonderfully fertile
country brought them to Portland, Oregon, where
Randolph&rsquo;s first move was to hunt up Bert Martin.</p>

<p>Bert and Susie were overjoyed to see their old
friends. They lived in a pretty cottage not far
from the railroad station, and Randolph had to
bring Kittie, Pet, Tom, Fred and Bess to take tea
with them.</p>

<p>When supper was finished, and the young people
had talked over the dear old Latin School days,
and the gay summer at the Isles of Shoals, Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
got a step-ladder and gathered handfuls of red
roses from the trellis over the front door, where
they grew in true Oregonian abundance.</p>

<p>Tom and Susie got on marvelously well together,
and the former showed a singular eagerness
to have Bert correspond with him, after he
should have arrived home in the East.</p>

<p>From Portland the managers had provided their
travelers with a little two-day side trip to the Dalles.</p>

<p>They rode in the cars all one afternoon along
the southern shore of the Columbia, stopping to
scramble up a steep hillside to the foot of the
beautiful Multnomah Falls, and arriving at Dalles
just after dark. Randolph and Fred were the
only ones who cared to explore the town, which
they conscientiously did, traveling miles, they
averred, over the plank sidewalks, and hopelessly
losing their way on several occasions; but turning
up in good season at last at the depot.</p>

<p>The train was side-tracked here, and tooting and
puffing engines, shifting freight cars, kept sleep
from the eyes of most of the party. At daybreak
they rose and made their way sleepily down to the
river, where a steamer was waiting for them.
Back they went, down the river to Portland. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
thick fog hid the &ldquo;mountainous and precipitous
cliffs&rdquo; and &ldquo;bold headlands&rdquo; which the guide-book
promised them.</p>

<p>Wearily they boarded the cars standing ready at
the Portland depot, and took possession of their
comfortable compartments and drawing-rooms for
their Eastward journey.</p>

<p>The next morning found them at Tacoma, and
then on the Northern Pacific, striking across the
new State of Washington. The Cascade Mountains&mdash;a
long and insurmountable barrier between
East and West&mdash;had to be crossed, and up went
the train, curving, groaning and winding, as the
Canadian Pacific had through the Rockies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Longest tunnel in America except the Hoosac!&rdquo;
screamed Tom above the din of the cars, as they
plunged into the &ldquo;Stampede.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nearly two
miles from end to end, and half a mile above the
level of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now came the most wearisome part of
the homeward journey. The sun rose in a cloudless
sky, and disclosed only hot, treeless, rolling
prairie as far as the eye could reach. In the cars
the mercury stood at ninety-six degrees, and linen
dusters were once more brought to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening they reached Spokane Falls, and
set forward their watches one hour. It gave the
travelers a queer sensation to arrive at a station at
nine o&rsquo;clock, stop half an hour, and start on at
half-past ten.</p>

<p>The following day they recrossed the Rocky
Mountains and descended the eastern slope,
through a pleasant farming country, to the city of
Helena. Here there was a stop of several hours,
and the boys had a good swim in the great tank
which was fed by hot springs.</p>

<p>When they were on board the train and in
motion once more, Tom was called on for the
&ldquo;probabilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;we shall
be in Cinnabar, seven miles from the Mammoth
Hot Springs. There we shall divide up into
parties, and &lsquo;do&rsquo; the Yellowstone Park in four-horse
mountain-wagons, taking about five days
for the job. It&rsquo;s going to be one of the biggest
things on the whole trip, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we must leave Yellowstone Park, surnamed
&ldquo;The Wonderland of America,&rdquo; for another
chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br /><br />

<small>WONDERLAND.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Tom, who had now
fully recovered from his recent unpleasantness
with the silver-tip. &ldquo;Hurrah! Here
we are in Cinnabar.&rdquo; He had jumped from the
car, and was tapping at Kittie&rsquo;s curtained window.</p>

<p>Kittie waved her hand to signify assent and
keep him quiet, and before long all the passengers
were hurrying through their breakfast and preparing
for the long coach journey through the park.
While this is going on, in the now motionless
Northern Pacific train, we have time for a few
words regarding the great reservation itself.</p>

<p>About one thirtieth of the new State of Wyoming&mdash;the
extreme northwest corner&mdash;is reserved
by the United States Government for the &ldquo;Yel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>lowstone
National Park.&rdquo; Nearly the whole area
thus set apart remains a virgin wilderness, traversed
only by rough and narrow carriage roads,
and hardly affording shelter to the increasing
number of tourists each summer in its hastily
erected hotels. The whole park is about the size
of Rhode Island and Delaware combined.</p>

<p>The Government, through the Secretary of the
Interior, has issued certain regulations regarding
the conduct of travelers in the park. These relate
chiefly to camping, destroying trees, etc.
One of the most stringent rules forbids the discharge
of firearms within the limits of the Reservation.
Mounted soldiers of the regular United
States Army are scattered all through the park,
doing police duty; and if you are caught firing a
gun, or even having one (unsealed) in your possession,
good-by to your fowling-piece and good-by to
the park. The former is at once confiscated, and
you are marched out of the latter without ceremony.
Those travelers who wish to take firearms
are obliged to have the lock sealed by a Government
official, at the entrance of the park.</p>

<p>The result of this wholesome regulation is that
wild game of all sorts is on the rapid increase, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
this favored spot. About one hundred and fifty
buffalo, the remnant of the immense herds that
once roamed the Western prairies, are peacefully
quartered somewhere among these wild hills&mdash;nobody
knows exactly where.</p>

<p>Most of these facts Tom hastily repeated to his
companions in the &ldquo;Broadwater,&rdquo; as the dining-car
was called. The ride over to Mammoth Hot
Springs was full of interest, the road following a
wild mountain-stream, and finding its way farther
and farther into the wilderness.</p>

<p>At one point an exclamation from Randolph
called the attention of the rest to an eagle&rsquo;s nest
on a jutting cliff that almost overhung the road.
The heads of the young eagles could be plainly
seen over the edge of the nest, and far overhead
soared the parent birds.</p>

<p>On making up the wagon parties at the hotel,
the Percivals found to their delight that all could
go in one team, including Mr. and Miss Selborne.
Off they went with shouts and cheers, leaving the
wonders of the &ldquo;Mammoth&rdquo; district for their
return trip.</p>

<p>Up and up, along the edge of frightful precipices,
where the road was built of planking, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
great props, sheer out around promontories of rock;
up and up, to the high tablelands of the park;
through evergreen forests, along silent lakes,
haunted by beavers and strange water-fowl; beside
black cliffs of volcanic glass, or &ldquo;obsidian&rdquo;;
across unbridged streams where the horses plunged
into the swift-running waters, and the wagon
lurched from side to side, hub-deep in the flood.
So onward until they had covered twenty-two
miles, and reached the Norris Geyser Basin, where
dinner was served in a long, shed-like structure
called a hotel.</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was over, the young people
hurried ahead on foot, to see their first geysers.
A quarter of a mile walk, and a sudden turn of
the road brought them into view. Strange, uncanny
things they were, bursting upward at intervals
through the treacherous and chalk-like
&ldquo;formation,&rdquo; and throwing their jets of steaming
water into the air with hollow gurgles and growls
from their hot throats.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was charged with sulphurous
odors, and while the travelers were fascinated with
the novelty and mystery of the scene, they were
glad to enter their wagons once more and press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
forward on their journey. They all felt the rarity
of the air, being about a thousand feet higher than
the summit of Mt. Washington, above the level of
the sea. It became very cold, too, as the sun
went down. The girls were glad to don their
sealskin capes, and the boys turned up their coat-collars.</p>

<p>Eighteen miles over the wildest country they
had yet seen, brought them to the Lower Geyser
Basin.</p>

<p>That night the hotel was so crowded that each
room was shared by three or four occupants.
Tom, Randolph, Fred and Rossiter were allotted
to a chamber in an outbuilding. They had to
reach it by an outside stairway, and I grieve to
state that all four&mdash;not excepting the Reverend
Rossiter Selborne&mdash;told stories and laughed over
them until very nearly midnight.</p>

<p>Next morning Rossiter left the room before the
boys were up, and walked out in the clear, cold
air. He had not taken a dozen steps when he
saw Bess and Kittie emerging from the main
building, which was dignified by the term &ldquo;hotel.&rdquo;
Hailing them merrily, he was soon at their side,
and the three walked down to the Firehole River,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
from whose sulphurous waters there arose a warm,
faint odor, as it foamed along its white-and-yellow-streaked
bed.</p>

<p>Over they went, one by one, on a narrow log
bridge to the further bank, which they followed
down to a little fir grove. There they had a tiny
camp-fire, taking great precautions to keep the
blaze down and use only dry twigs, so as not to
make a smoke.</p>

<p>After breakfast the teams were ready again,
and the journey was resumed. For twelve miles
they rode among geysers and springs, through low
fir woods, over chalky formation, to the Upper
Basin, where they were to spend the night.</p>

<p>On the way, it should be mentioned, they
stopped to view a singular mud spring, called the
&ldquo;Mammoth Paint Pot.&rdquo; There was a bowl-shaped
crater nearly filled with gray, pasty mud, through
the surface of which great bubbles slowly forced
themselves, as in a boiling kettle of molasses
candy, nearly done. As one of the guide-books
said, there was &ldquo;a continuous bubbling up of mud,
producing sounds like a hoarsely whispered &lsquo;plop,
plop.&rsquo;&rdquo; Travelers were further informed that
these bubbling circlets of mud fell into beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
floral forms; but Kittie could find in them no resemblance
to anything but electric bell knobs;
while her mother plaintively declared they looked
like nothing so much as old-fashioned doughnuts.</p>

<p>That evening Tom caused great merriment at
the supper-table by gravely asking Mrs. Percival
to &ldquo;pass the plops,&rdquo; he having previously ordered
doughnuts for that purpose.</p>

<p>But if I were to tell you of all the wonders the
Percivals visited and heard with their ears and saw
with their eyes, I might be accused of writing a
guide-book myself. I can only add that during
the next forty-eight hours our friends became intimately
acquainted with a dozen or more great
geysers, knowing their names and the times for
their appearance to the hour, if not the minute.</p>

<p>There was the &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; (this was passed
on the right between the Lower and Upper
Basins), the largest geyser in the world; the
&ldquo;Giant,&rdquo; throwing a huge volume of scalding
water high into the air every eight days; the
&ldquo;Grotto,&rdquo; with a crater of strange, irregular walls
as if built by gnomes; the &ldquo;Castle,&rdquo; to the brink
of which two of the girls climbed and gazed fearlessly
down into the terrible throat; and &ldquo;Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Faithful&rdquo; which spouts a hundred feet once every
sixty-five minutes, and has probably been as
prompt as a clock, scientific men tell us, for the
last twenty thousand years.</p>

<p>A comical incident occurred as the party were
standing near the last-named geyser waiting for it
to &ldquo;erupt.&rdquo; Tom had timed it by his watch, and
had given out word that it would begin to play in
just three minutes and a half.</p>

<p>While the words were on his lips, a man was
seen approaching from a camp near by, carrying a
bucket and some clothes which he evidently intended
to wash in warm water from one of the
many pools near the crater&rsquo;s mouth. It was then
merely a hole, some four or five feet in diameter,
from which came occasional wreaths of steam, and
an ominous gurgling growl which the new-comer
disregarded altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait!&rdquo; cried Tom to the rest. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t
near enough to get hurt, but he&rsquo;ll be about the
most astonished man in Wyoming in just one minute
and three quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The camper proceeded to dip up a bucket full of
water with great coolness, and, having taken a
comfortable seat on a ridge of &ldquo;formation,&rdquo; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
just proceeding to immerse his wash, when up
came &ldquo;Old Faithful&rsquo;s&rdquo; head. In less time than
it takes to tell it, the great, roaring, boiling jet
was hurling itself far aloft, and descending in
floods of hot, sulphurous water. The man had
given one startled look over his shoulder at the
first outbreak, and then fled like a deer, leaving
his property to be reclaimed later in the day. The
sight of his ludicrously startled face and flying
heels was irresistible, and the boys screamed with
laughter.</p>

<p>Beside the great, active geysers, there were
multitudes of hot springs, some of them many
feet wide and deep, with treacherous, overhanging
banks and exquisitely tinted depths of turquoise
and sapphire, through which arose a continuous
train of silvery bubbles. There was a story told,
that summer, of a lady who had neglected the
precautions which others took, and straying carelessly
among these springs, broke through the
thin crust of sulphurous deposit. She was instantly
drawn out, but not before she was terribly
scalded.</p>

<p>While the Percivals were at the &ldquo;Upper Geyser
Basin,&rdquo; they were invited to witness a queer sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
in the edge of the woods about a quarter of a mile
from the hotel, just at dusk. One of the men
employed about the place began to call coaxingly,
&ldquo;Barney! Barney!&rdquo; And now a dark form appeared
among the pines, and out came a huge
black bear. He approached timidly within a few
feet of the silent group, now advancing, now
bounding lightly away at the cracking of a twig,
and took several pieces of raw meat from a stump
near by. When his silent meal was finished, he
gave the spectators one inquiring look, and wheeling
round, disappeared in the shadow of the forest.</p>

<p>All this time it was very cold, especially at
night when, although it was in August, ice formed
over pools about the hotel.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the tourists left the wonders of the
&ldquo;Upper Basin&rdquo; behind, and drove on toward the
next point of interest, Yellowstone Lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us the points, Tom,&rdquo; Randolph sings
out, as the driver cracks his whip and the wagon
rattles down the road. &ldquo;Tell us about the Lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly eight thousand feet above the sea,&rdquo;
rejoins Tom. He is so ready with his figures that
skeptical Kittie declares he makes them up, whenever
his memory fails him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you think,&rdquo; rejoins Thomas, with
dignity, &ldquo;that the Lake doesn&rsquo;t cover one hundred
and thirty-nine square miles, and hasn&rsquo;t a
hundred miles of shore line, and isn&rsquo;t chock-full
of splendid trout, and hasn&rsquo;t a beautiful beach of
obsidian five miles long, &lsquo;reflecting the sun&rsquo;s rays
like brilliant gems,&rsquo; and doesn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! stop, stop, Davy; I&rsquo;ll come down,&rdquo; cried
Kittie; while Fred strikes up &ldquo;Annie Rooney&rdquo;
at the top of his voice. It was afternoon when
they drove down into a pretty valley where were
clustered three or four large white tents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this&mdash;a circus?&rdquo; shouted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Larry Matthews&rsquo; hotel,&rdquo; replied the driver.</p>

<p>Out came Larry himself, as the teams drew up
with a flourish, before the door of the principal
tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see yez, ladies an&rsquo; gintlemen!&rdquo; he
cried, with broad, rich brogue. &ldquo;Step right into
me parlor, but be careful of the carpet, av ye
plase!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the tent knew no floor but turf, this raised
a laugh, and this was followed by another and
another at Larry&rsquo;s quaint observations, which he
showered without stint on his guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were all seated at long tables, he
was everywhere at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milk, sor? Milk it is. Eggs? there&rsquo;s wan
the little speckled hin laid for you, mem! Coffee?
Do take another cup! There&rsquo;s plenty more to be
had&mdash;the geyser&rsquo;s playin&rsquo; right along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meal was eaten in a gale of merriment, and
all hands declared that sandwiches, boiled eggs
and coffee&mdash;for of these viands it largely consisted&mdash;had
never tasted so good.</p>

<p>After dinner there was an hour or two of
leisure, during which the travelers strolled about
on the hillside overlooking &ldquo;Trout Creek&rdquo; (for
which this little encampment was named), securing
kodak views, and enjoying life generally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, sor! Good-by, mem!&rdquo; shouted Larry
to his guests, as they at length clambered to their
seats and rode off. &ldquo;Long life to yez all! Come
ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They now had a dozen miles of beautiful prairie,
river and mountain scenery before reaching the
Lake. The ride was not without attractions also,
that bordered on the perilous.</p>

<p>At one point they were told by the driver that
only three weeks before, a huge buffalo had sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>denly
emerged from the woods, and with lowered
head galloped across the road. The six horses of
the team immediately in front had been thrown
into wild panic, and wheeling about, had dashed
off, dragging a broken wagon after them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I had to dodge a buffalo and a runaway
team,&rdquo; concluded John grimly.</p>

<p>The wheel-tracks showed plainly in the turf
where he had lashed his own horses out of the
road. He added that one of the passengers, a
lady from the East, was quite severely injured in
jumping from the forward wagon.</p>

<p>They saw deer feeding quietly beside the road.
Great white pelicans floated on the calm surface
of the river; eagles flew overhead in full view.
There are many pumas, or &ldquo;mountain lions,&rdquo; as
they are called there, in the lonelier tracts of
the park, and bears, brown, black and grizzly,
roam to and fro unmolested.</p>

<p>But the great feature of the ride was presented
about five miles further on&mdash;when they were
driving close to the banks of a clear flowing
stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that creature down by the water?&rdquo;
asked Adelaide carelessly. &ldquo;A calf?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all glanced toward the river, when Tom&mdash;who
was unquestionably authority on the subject&mdash;sung
out, &ldquo;A bear! A bear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The driver pulled up his horses with a jerk, and
none too soon. Up scrambled a huge brown, or
&ldquo;cinnamon&rdquo; bear from the bank of the river, not
a hundred yards ahead of them. She jumped a
log which lay along the embankment, and crossing
the road, began to climb the steep, wooded hill
on their left.</p>

<p>Presently a woolly cub, about the size of a half-grown
Newfoundland dog, came hurrying after
her. He tried to climb the log as she had done,
but after straining to get over, exactly like a boy
endeavoring to mount a horizontal bar, tumbled
backward into the brush.</p>

<p>Fred and Tom cheered him on, and the second
attempt succeeded. Down he went, head over
heels, into the dusty road, and then how he did
scramble up hill after his mother! The boys
laughed and shouted to him until both bears were
out of sight among the pines, far up the mountain
slope.</p>

<p>The horses had acted bravely during this
scene, merely standing with quivering limbs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
alert ears until little Bruin and his mother had
passed.</p>

<p>At Yellowstone Lake the boys hastily organized
a fishing excursion, and came back with a fine
string of trout, averaging a pound to a pound and
a half apiece. In the evening they took the girls
out on the lake for a moonlight row. The songs
they sang were of a gentler and more plaintive
character than usual; for they realized that the
beautiful journey over gulf and glacier, and through
Wonderland, was fast drawing to a close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Row, brothers, row!&rdquo; rang out Pet&rsquo;s sweet
soprano; and even Fred&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jolly boating weather&rdquo;
had an undertone of sadness, as the chorus came
in, full and strong, at the end of each verse. Ah!
how far ahead a &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; casts its shadow.
How will it seem to reach a land where the word
is not known!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rapids are near, and the daylight&rsquo;s past,&rdquo;
sang Pet; while the moonlight quivered on the
waters of the strange, wild mountain lake.</p>

<p>I must hurry on, myself, in my story of those
fair, sweet days and silvery nights; for I find
myself lingering only too long among the hills&mdash;dreading
perhaps, as I trust some of you do, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
boy and girl readers, the parting from the glad
young lives that, in the course of these six
volumes, have become a part of my very own.
Yes, my manly Randolph, impulsive, good-hearted
Tom, merry Kittie, golden-haired Pet, and sweet,
gentle &ldquo;Captain Bess,&rdquo; I must leave you all too
soon, in the fair morning-land where hearts beat
warmly and young faces glow with mirth and
noble resolve; whither in very truth, I have tried,
poorly and feebly but most earnestly, to take the
real, living boys and girls who have gathered
around the pine-cone fires and many a time have
sent me words of cheer from their own far-away
firesides, year after year. God bless them, every
one!</p>

<p class='npara'>Randolph and Fred were loath to leave the fine
fishing-grounds of the Lake, but the word was
&ldquo;Onward!&rdquo; and another day&rsquo;s ride took the party
away from those picturesque shores to the Grand
Cañon of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>On horseback they rode slowly along the banks
of this mighty ravine, whose tawny flanks have
given the river its name. One moment the girls
were speechless with laughter over Tom&rsquo;s dismay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
as his horse began to slide down a steep descent;
the next they caught their breath with wonder
and awe, as they came out on the brink of the
mighty cañon, and, making their way on foot to
the very edge of a jutting promontory, gazed
downward into the fearful depths of a sheer
thousand feet below.</p>

<p>A few rods from their narrow perch was an
eagle&rsquo;s nest, and it made the head giddy and the
pulse beat fast to see the great birds float out
over the abyss. Coiling along the very base of the
precipices was the river, a silken thread of twisted
white and emerald.</p>

<p>But oh! the Falls. Here the Yellowstone gathered
itself, at the head of the Cañon, and leaped
abroad into the air, falling three hundred feet
before it knitted together its torn threads on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In His hands are the deep places of the earth,&rdquo;
murmured Mr. Percival, half to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strength of the hills is His also!&rdquo; finished
the young clergyman, involuntarily baring
his head, as if in the visible presence of the
Creator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can He&mdash;how can He think of our little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
every-day-nesses, and of that!&rdquo; said Bess, not turning
to the last speaker, but knowing that he heard.</p>

<p>Rossiter stooped, picked a single blade of grass
from the brink of the awful cataract, and handed
it to her without a word. And she understood,
and was grateful.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br /><br />

<small>WHITE LILIES.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Home again, from a foreign shore!&rdquo; sang
the Percival Glee Club, as the mountain
wagon rattled down a long hill, across a dusty
plain, and whirled up to the front door of a great
hotel. It wasn&rsquo;t home, really, but only the Mammoth
Hot Springs, which they had left nearly a
week before.</p>

<p>Half of the Excursion had taken the circuit
through the Park in the opposite direction, and
now that all were united once more, many were
the handshakings, and loud and eager the exchange
of experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you take dinner at Larry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost tumbled into the &lsquo;Morning Glory&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what a funny hotel that was at the Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Basin&mdash;walls of pasteboard between the rooms,
and all peeling off, you know&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you awfully cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many trout did you catch, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! wasn&rsquo;t Mary&rsquo;s Hill steep? We got out
and walked. The horses just went up hand over
hand, as if &rsquo;twas a ladder&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see a bear?&rdquo; This last from Tom, who
became the center of a knot of eager questioners,
and assumed airs of importance accordingly.</p>

<p>The attractions of the Mammoth Springs, marvelous
though they were, were rather slighted by
the tourists, who were sated with &ldquo;formations&rdquo;
and boiling pools. That afternoon the train bore
them over the branch road to Livingston, where
fine furs were purchased by several parties, this
little frontier town being a regular emporium for
such articles.</p>

<p>At nightfall they had a jolly supper in the car,
and afterward made their Pullman ring with &ldquo;The
Soldier&rsquo;s Farewell&rdquo; and&mdash;well&mdash;&ldquo;A. R.!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the next day they rode at thirty-five miles
an hour through the &ldquo;Bad Lands&rdquo; and across
North Dakota, reaching Minneapolis the following
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, it&rsquo;s good to see green grass again,
after those scorched-up prairies!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom;
and the rest echoed his words. For weeks not a
drop of rain had fallen in the Northwest, and our
New Englanders had longed for a sight of the
fresh verdure of their own homeland.</p>

<p>There was plenty of sightseeing in Minneapolis
to crowd the few hours allowed there. The
younger Percivals, in particular, rushed furiously
about the city, visited the Falls of Minnehaha,
&ldquo;which were extremely interesting,&rdquo; Fred Seacomb
remarked, &ldquo;except that there were no falls
there&rdquo;&mdash;only a narrow rivulet trickling over some
mossy rocks in a park; and climbed (by elevator)
to the top of a twelve-story building on the roof
of which was a flourishing garden, as well as an
elegant restaurant. Later in the day they hurriedly
inspected one of the great &ldquo;Pillsbury&rdquo;
mills, which turn out seven thousand barrels of
flour a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like this better than even the Falls in the
Grand Cañon,&rdquo; whispered Bess to Kittie, as they
watched the flour pouring down through the boxes
in a beautiful white flood. &ldquo;There it was a great
Power, you know; as if you were somehow seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the world made; but here is where He makes
answers for prayers for daily bread&mdash;just think,
seven thousand people a day getting a whole
barrel apiece, somewhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am glad Mr. Selborne happened to hear that
last sentence. He was learning to know the little
Captain better and better every day; and he
understood what she meant, perhaps even better
than bright, saucy Pet did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pleasant to remember, Miss Bessie,&rdquo; he
said, taking up the conversation very simply,
&ldquo;that the power and the giving are not separate,
but each a part of the great, lovely Plan that
guides the world&rsquo;s living. &lsquo;He watereth the
hills,&rsquo; you know, &lsquo;from His chambers,&rsquo; and the
flood that roared over the brink of that precipice
is sure to fall somewhere on the earth, at some
time, in gentle rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Bess, catching her breath a little,
as she has a pretty way of doing when she is
deeply moved; &ldquo;and there was the blade of grass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She might have said &ldquo;is,&rdquo; for don&rsquo;t I know that
that self-same blade was safely pressed in her little
Testament, in the steamer trunk that she had
shared with Kittie throughout the journey?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>They &ldquo;finished&rdquo; Minneapolis and its sturdy
rival St. Paul, and hurried on to Chicago. Several
in the original hundred of the Excursion had left
them, and strangers had taken their places. It
began to seem like breaking up in earnest.</p>

<p>There was one thing that disturbed Randolph;
namely, that he had been unable to fulfill a laughing
request made by Pet at almost the outset of
the journey. He had competed with Tom in
securing wild flowers for the girls, and, it must
be confessed, the finest specimens had somehow
found their way into Miss Pet&rsquo;s lap. One variety
had followed another during the passage by rail,
across New England and Canada, until Pet had
cried out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not every kind,&rdquo; he replied, breathing hard
after a run he had just made for some great golden
daisies. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some special flower you
want, that you haven&rsquo;t had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me see&mdash;a water lily!&rdquo; said the
girl merrily, choosing the most unlikely flower she
could think of at the moment.</p>

<p>Randolph had laughed, too, but had resolved in
his inmost heart to procure just that particular
white blossom, if it could be had for love, muscle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
or money. But no lilies could be found. All
through Manitoba, Assiniboia and Alberta he had
looked in vain. Alaska yielded fir and spruce in
abundance, but no water lilies. Nor was he more
successful during the homeward-bound trip, across
the States. Pet said nothing more about it&mdash;indeed,
I think she forgot her careless suggestion
almost the moment it was made; but Randolph
felt himself put on his mettle, and failure stared
him in the face.</p>

<p>No, I am not writing a &ldquo;love story,&rdquo; unless you
grant that all true stories are that, in which pure,
sweet young lives are thrown together, and drawn
to one another by finest and frankest sympathy,
looking ahead no farther than the sunset of that
day or the sunrise of the next.</p>

<p>What might come in the future, these honest,
joyous young people did not try to fathom. Perhaps
for some of them the sacredness of a life-long
companionship was waiting&mdash;who could tell? but
now they just took the sweetness and comradery
of To-day, and were satisfied.</p>

<p>As for Randolph&rsquo;s failure to procure the lily,
more of that by and by.</p>

<p>For there was one marvel, familiar to some, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
new to most of the party, yet to come&mdash;the Falls
of Niagara.</p>

<p>Chicago, with its never-ceasing stir of business
activity, its broad streets, its huge &ldquo;Auditorium&rdquo;
building, twenty stories high, its art galleries and
its good-natured Western hurry and hospitality,
was left behind, and one misty morning in early
September the Excursion train deposited its passengers
at the Niagara depot, from which they were
whirled round to the Cataract House for breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom hates to waste his time eating in the
vicinity of Niagara Falls,&rdquo; said Fred at the table,
&ldquo;but I am glad to see that he is going through the
form, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glance at the latter&rsquo;s heaped-up plate was
convincing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly a splendid imitation of a hungry
boy,&rdquo; remarked Kittie. &ldquo;Take another biscuit,
won&rsquo;t you, Tommy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when at last they did enter Prospect Park,
and huddled together at the brink of the mighty
American Falls, there were no more jests. All
the world seemed sweeping onward and over, into
that white uproar. The solid rock beneath them
trembled in the thunderous fall of many waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the party walked over the little rustic
bridge to Goat Island, and out to the bit of rock
where Terrapin Tower once stood. But it was
all too terrible to invite a long stay. Glad they
were to reach the quiet of the grove again, where
moss and furrowed bark and waving fern told
their simple story of peace, and the sparrow&rsquo;s
twitter was heard against the deep undertone of
the Fall.</p>

<p>In the afternoon half a dozen of the bolder
spirits went down the Inclined Plane to the shore
below the Falls, and embarked on the <i>Maid
of the Mist</i>. They had to encase themselves in
rubber coats and tarpaulin hats, while the little
boat steamed up into the verge of the boiling caldron
until its awe-struck passengers were deafened
and drenched by the columns of rolling spray from
the cataract.</p>

<p>Evening came, and for the last time the Percivals,
with their special friends, gathered in the car
for a final &ldquo;concert.&rdquo; Nearly one half of the
Excursion party had left them at Niagara, waving
handkerchiefs and singing, &ldquo;Should auld acquaintance
be forgot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rossiter and his sister were to reach their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
journey&rsquo;s end at a little town in Western Massachusetts,
and would leave the train in the early
morning, while their comrades were still asleep.
Altogether, despite the anticipation of getting
home once more, it was a sad evening, as
&ldquo;good-by&rdquo; evenings must always be.</p>

<p>Next morning all was eagerness and bustle, for
when breakfast was over the train was within
twenty miles of Boston.</p>

<p>Alaskan paddles and totem poles were lashed
together, and the sharp noses and bright eyes of
stuffed foxes from Mandan peered from their
paper wrappings as their owners prepared for the
last disembarkation.</p>

<p>Near historic Concord the train stopped for a
local freight to pull out of the way. Randolph
carelessly strolled out to the car platform, and
cast his eye along a little stream which was
crossed by the track at that point. Something
made him start suddenly and beckon to a group
of boys who were idling near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver dollar for the boy that brings me a
pond lily before the train starts!&rdquo; he cried,
pointing to the river.</p>

<p>How those boys did scatter, some up stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
some down! One bright little fellow, who had
just divested himself for a bath, plunged in and
swam lustily for the prize. Another waded in,
waist-deep, regardless of clothes. Half a dozen
more threw themselves on to a rude raft, capsized
it, and scrambling on board again, poled it toward
the white beauties, floating serenely on the dark
waters of the Assabet.</p>

<p>Randolph stood waiting eagerly, with the dollar
in his hand, expecting every moment to hear the
signal-whistle for starting. A group of workmen
engaged in repairing the bridge left off working
and cheered the boys on, laughing, and shouting
to the little fellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go it, Dick! Now, Billy, there&rsquo;s a big one in
front of you&mdash;no, to your right, to your right!
Hurry, Pat, you&rsquo;ll get it! Good for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off brakes!&rdquo; rang out the whistle sharply.
The train started. Four boys scrambled, panting,
up the steep, sandy bank. Randolph jumped on
the lowest step of the car and stretched out his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are, Mister!&rdquo; and four snowy, perfumed
blossoms were thrust by grimy little fingers
into his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; he shouted, throwing out four bright
silver quarters for which he had hastily changed
the dollar. &ldquo;Thank you, boys. Good-by!&rdquo; and
the train rolled on.</p>

<p>Randolph entered the car, his eyes shining.
Evidently no one within had witnessed this little
episode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost home,&rdquo; he said, coming up behind Pet.
&ldquo;Too bad I couldn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that lily,&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;Well,
Randolph, perhaps it will do you good to fail
just once. It&rsquo;s a sort of discipline, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to get my discipline
some other way,&rdquo; said Randolph demurely; and
he deposited the lilies in the lap of astonished Pet.</p>

<p>Just what she saw in those exquisite, fragrant
things, all dripping from the cool depths from
which they had come to greet her, I cannot say.
She looked her delight at Randolph, and then
buried the pretty pink of her own cheeks in the
white petals. I believe she did not even thank
the giver; but he was satisfied.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the train thundered into
the Fitchburg depot in Boston, and the long, ten-thousand
mile journey was at an end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br /><br />

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>I have entitled this chapter &ldquo;Conclusion,&rdquo;
because it seems necessary to have the last
chapter of a book named in that way. But the
author might as well have named it &ldquo;Beginning,&rdquo;
for there is no such thing in life as a &ldquo;conclusion,&rdquo;
unless, indeed (as Randolph, looking over
my shoulder, and fresh from the classic shades of
Cambridge, suggests), we take the literal meaning
of the word, a &ldquo;shutting together&rdquo;&mdash;of the
covers of this book!</p>

<p>No; life is full of beginnings, and stories can
never, never, to all eternity, &ldquo;conclude.&rdquo; Because
the &ldquo;Pine Cone Stories&rdquo; can have but just six
volumes, of so many pages each, we must let the
story go on without us. But it will not conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
any more than your life or mine forever. With
which little &ldquo;preachment,&rdquo; as Miss Alcott&rsquo;s young
people somewhere call it, let us take a last look at
the friends whose stories are drifting away out of
our sight.</p>

<p>More than three years have passed since Tom
delivered that lucky shot at old Silver-Tip; since
Bessie gazed thoughtfully down into the mighty
cañon in the Yellowstone, and took in her hand
the slender ribbon of grass for a token.</p>

<p>It is Christmas time, and we are in an old mansion
house in the depths of a deep forest in the
Pine Tree State. You recognize the room at
once, I hope&mdash;for it is Uncle Will&rsquo;s little secret
chamber at the Pines.</p>

<p>It is night, and the North Wind is smiting
grandly his &ldquo;thunder harp of pines,&rdquo; while the
window panes whiten and rattle with the sheets of
snow that are flung against them by the storm.</p>

<p>There is a glorious fire in the fireplace, throwing
great billows of flame far up the chimney,
crackling, snapping and purring, sending a ruddy
glow into every corner of the room and over its
inmates.</p>

<p>For the chamber is not empty; the fire is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
talking to itself, but to a goodly company that
gather around it, with all the old-time cheer.</p>

<p>Uncle Will is there, sturdy and broad-shouldered
as ever, with hair only a little whiter than when
we first met him, standing beside his good horses
at the Pineville depot years ago.</p>

<p>Aunt Puss, too, is not far away, and her husband&rsquo;s
occasional &ldquo;Eunice&rdquo; is even more full of
tenderness than in earlier days, when they met by
the lilac bushes.</p>

<p>Close by her side nestles golden-haired Pet, who
turns, however, as she talks, to a tall youth with
a dark curling mustache, whom she addresses as
Randolph. The flush on her cheeks and the brightness
in her happy eyes is not alone borrowed from
the dancing fire; for Randolph has just stooped
down and whispered to his aunt&mdash;Pet knew
perfectly well, too, what he was saying, sly puss!&mdash;that
the wedding-day was set for the first of
May.</p>

<p>In another corner of the room Tom, now a
grave senior at Harvard, is reading by the fire-light
a letter postmarked &ldquo;Portland, Oregon.&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t believe Bert Martin wrote it, though there
is a great deal in the letter about him; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
handwriting is decidedly feminine. Can it be that
Bert employs his sister as an amanuensis?</p>

<p>The young lady in navy blue, next to Tom,
must be Kittie, whose engagement to Fred Seacomb
&ldquo;came out&rdquo; simultaneously with Randolph
and Pet&rsquo;s. She tells me privately that she can
not help teasing him, he&rsquo;s so dignified with his
new instructorship in the University of Pennsylvania;
but then he&rsquo;s good-natured and don&rsquo;t seem
to mind it a bit&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;so long as he has me,&rsquo; he
says&mdash;foolish fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard from Bess lately?&rdquo; asks
Uncle Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only last week,&rdquo; replies Tom, throwing a
handful of cones on the fire, and then trying to
get the pitch off his white hands. &ldquo;She and Ross
were in Geneva, and having a glorious time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad when she is back in this country
again,&rdquo; remarks Aunt Puss, stroking Pet&rsquo;s
bright hair. &ldquo;If all my girls should run away so
far, as soon as they were married, I don&rsquo;t know
what I should do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pet laughs and blushes a little, and assures her
aunt that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no danger!&rdquo; For she and
Randolph have talked it over, you see, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
resolved on another Alaskan trip, where they can
renew their memories of that bright summer
among the gulfs and glaciers of the far Northwest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for the sake of old times&rdquo; Uncle Will
tells a story, while the red blaze crackles around a
plentiful supply of cones and curling sheets of
&ldquo;silver rags.&rdquo; Without, the northern crosses all
through the wood are white with snow, and the
wind rises until in its continuous voice can be
heard a roar as of the kelp-laden surges around
the lonely reefs of Appledore.</p>

<p>There is silence in the little chamber as young
folk and old gaze dreamily into the heart of the
fire, their thoughts full of dear old days, yet looking
forward, strong, trustful, hopeful, to the shelter
that shall be for them in the heart of every storm
that may assail them; to the work and the joy
and the gladness of life that is set before them.</p>

<p><b>BRAVE GIRLS.</b></p>

<p>When young people see the name of Nora Perry, Mary Hartwell Catherwood or
Frank H. Converse appended to a story, they prick up their ears at once, for they
have learned to expect something of unusual interest. They will not be disappointed
when they open this book and read about Glen Hastings, Kate Oxford, Sharly Raymond
and Bessy May&mdash;brave girls every one, but in divers ways. Other writers
almost as well known as these favorites have helped in no slight degree to swell this

Rev. Phillips Brooks, D. D. 12mo, 1.00.</p>

<p>Few English clergymen are better known in this country than Frederic D. Maurice,
whose untimely death, some years ago, deprived not only England, but the Christian
world, of one of its ablest religious teachers. He devoted a great deal of his time to
the social and religious needs of the common people.</p>

<p>Maurice was a dear friend of Tennyson. The following lines in one of the poet&rsquo;s
best-known pieces refer to his friend:</p>
</div>

<p class='poem'>
&ldquo;How best to help the slender store,<br />
How mend the dwellings of the poor,<br />
How gain in life as life advances,<br />
Valor and charity more and more.&rdquo;<br />
</p>


<p class='bauthor'>FARMAN (Ella). (Mrs. C. S. Pratt.)</p>

unexpected causes for happiness and gladness.</p>


<p><b>THE COOKING-CLUB OF TU-WHIT HOLLOW.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.25.</p>


<p>The practical instructions in housewifery, which are abundant, are set in the midst
of a bright wholesome story. Girls who read this book will not be able to keep house
at once, but they will learn to do some things, and they will have an hour or two of
genuine pleasure in discovering how there came to be a cooking-club and in tracing its
history.</p>


<p><b>GOOD-FOR-NOTHING POLLY.</b> 12mo, illustrated, 1.00.</p>


<p>Polly is not a girl at all, but a boy, a slangy, school-hating, fun-loving, wilful, big-hearted
boy. &ldquo;Nagged&rdquo; continually at home, he wastes his time upon the streets and
finally runs away. The book tells of his adventures. Mrs. Pratt has a keen insight
into the joys and sorrows of the little appreciated boy-life. Like Robert J. Burdette,
she is a master of humor and often touches a tender chord of pathos. Every boy will
be delighted with this book and every mother ought to read it who is, all unwittingly
perhaps, &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; her own noisy boy out of the home.</p>

<div class='pblockquot'>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-for-Nothing Polly&rsquo; will doubtless
gain the admiration and win the
graces of as large a circle of readers in
England as it has already done in the

</div>

<p><b>HOW TWO GIRLS TRIED FARMING.</b> 12mo, illustrated,
1.00.</p>


<p>A narrative of an actual experience.</p>

<div class='pblockquot'>

<p>&ldquo;The two girls who tried farming
solved a problem by taking the bull by
the horns, and that is often as effectual a
means as can be resorted to. They had
for capital one thousand dollars. With
this they bought thirty-five acres of
scraggy farm land. Then they hired out
as lady help for the winter and laid by
enough money to buy clover seed, and a
horse and a few other necessities. Dolly
had learned to plough and harrow and
make hay, and even to cut wood. Both
girls worked hard and it is pleasant to
chronicle their success. Now they have
a prosperous farm, and raise cows, sheep,
pigs and chickens, and as they do everything
to the best of their ability, their
products are in constant demand.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St.
Louis Post Despatch.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We recommend it to those girls who
are wearing out their lives at the sewing-machine,
behind counters or even at the
teacher&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Herald.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The success of the farm is almost
surpassed by the charm of the record.
It shows a touch of refinement and a
degree of literary skill no less uncommon
than the enterprise which has converted
a bleak hill-top of Michigan into a smiling
garden.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
